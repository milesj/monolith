# File groups are a mechanism for grouping similar types of files within a project using file glob
# patterns. These groups are then used by tasks to calculate functionality like cache computation,
# affected files since last change, command line arguments, deterministic builds, and more.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a list of
# globs. Globs are relative to a project, even though they are defined globally. This enables
# enforcement of organizational patterns across all projects in the workspace.
fileGroups:
  # List of configuration files located within the project root.
  configs:
    - '*.{js,json}'

  # List of non-test JavaScript/TypeScript source files.
  # This may include runtime, published, or distributable files.
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'

  # List of non-source JavaScript/TypeScript test files.
  # This may include unit tests, E2E tests, stories, etc.
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*.test.*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'

  # All static assets within the project.
  # This may include styles, images, videos, etc.
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.s?css'
    - '**/*.mdx?'
