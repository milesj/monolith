# File groups are a mechanism for grouping similar types of files within a project
# using file glob patterns. These groups are then used by tasks to calculate functionality like
# cache computation, affected files since last change, command line arguments, deterministic
# builds, and more.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a list of
# globs. Globs are relative to a project, even though they are defined globally. This enables
# enforcement of organizational patterns across all projects in the workspace.
fileGroups:
  configs:
    - '*.{js,json}'
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*.test.*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
    - '**/*.mdx'

# A task is a command that is ran within the context of a project. Tasks that are
# defined here and inherited by all projects within the workspace, but can be
# overridden per project.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name for the task,
# and the value is an object of task parameters. Learn more about tasks and inheritance.
