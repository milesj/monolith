## Auto-detect base/head for `moon ci`

We've updated [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) to try and detect the base and head revisions
automatically when running in a popular CI provider, like GitLab and Jenkins. For the base revision,
we'll use the base/target commit SHA or target branch, while the head revision will use the source
commit SHA or `HEAD`. This is great for pull requests and forks!

With that said, these values can be overwritten with environment variables, or command line
arguments. Below is the order of precedence:

- `MOON_BASE` / `MOON_HEAD` environment variables
- `--base` / `--head` command line arguments
- `base_revision` / `head_revision` via CI provider
- `vcs.defaultBranch` setting / `HEAD` literal value

> This functionality is provided by the [`ci_env`](https://github.com/milesj/rust-cicd-env) Rust
> crate. Please refer to that crate for supported providers, and which of them support revision
> detection (primarily the `base_revision` and `head_revision` fields).

## Include dependents for focused project graph

When running [`moon project-graph <id>`](/docs/commands/project-graph), we visualize a graph of the
focused project and all of its dependencies (other projects it depends on). However, if you wanted
to also visualize dependents (other projects that depend on the focused project), this was currently
not possible.

We felt this information could be useful, so we've added a `--dependents`
flattenDiagnosticMessageText, which will include direct dependents in the graph.

```shell
$ moon project-graph server --dependents
```

We also felt dependent information can be useful when querying projects, so have also added support
for the `--dependents` flag to the [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) command.

```shell
$ moon query projects --affected --dependents
```
