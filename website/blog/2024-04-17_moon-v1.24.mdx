## Auto-detect base/head for `moon ci`

We've updated [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) to try and detect the base and head revisions
automatically when running in a popular CI provider, like GitLab, Jenkins. For the base revision,
we'll use the base/target commit SHA or target branch, while the head revision with use the source
commit SHA or `HEAD`. This is great for pull requests and forks!

With that said, these values can be overwritten with environment variables, or command line
arguments. Below is the order of precedence:

- `MOON_BASE` / `MOON_HEAD` environment variables
- `--base` / `--head` command line arguments
- `base_revision` / `head_revision` via CI provider
- `vcs.defaultBranch` setting / `HEAD` literal value

> This functionality is provided by the [`ci_env`](https://github.com/milesj/rust-cicd-env) Rust
> crate. Please refer to that crate for supported providers, and which of them support revision
> detection (primarily the `base_revision` and `head_revision` fields).
