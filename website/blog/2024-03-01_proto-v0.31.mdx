In preparation for an official v1 release, we've improved stability, the overall developer
experience, we're renaming some commands, and removing the "global packages" functionality.

## Improved version pinning

Based on feedback from the community, we've made some slight changes to pinning to reduce confusion.
The biggest points of contention were, "Why does `proto install --pin` pin globally?", and "Why
doesn't `proto pin` resolve the version like `proto install --pin` does?".

To remedy the first issue, we've updated the `--pin` argument to optionally support a string value
of "local" or "global". When local, will pin to the `.prototools` file in the current directory,
otherwise it will pin to `~/.proto/.prototools`.

```shell
$ proto install node --pin # global
$ proto install node --pin global
$ proto install node --pin local
```

As for the second issue, we've introduced a new option called `--resolve`, which will resolve the
version to a fully qualified semantic version (or fail). This isn't the default functionality, as to
not break existing workflows, and because you may want to actually pin "1" instead of "1.2.3".

```shell
$ proto pin node 1 # 1
$ proto pin node 1 --resolve # 1.2.3
```

## Removed global package management (breaking)

## Renamed commands (breaking)

We're still not happy with some of the current command names, especially around tools and plugins,
so we've renamed a few of them. They are:

- Renamed the `proto tool` commands to `proto plugin`. An alias still exists for the time being.
- Removed the `proto tool list-plugins` command, and merged its functionality into
  `proto plugin list`.

As for the `proto plugin list` command, we've removed the versions and aliases from the output by
default, and wrapped them in new `--versions` and `--aliases` options.

## Other changes

- Fixed an issue where empty version strings were being parsed, causing failures.
