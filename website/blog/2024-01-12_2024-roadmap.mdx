Happy new year! Let's start 2024 by reflecting on last year and diving into our tentative year long
roadmap.

<!--truncate-->

## Year 2023 in review

Last year was an extremely exciting year for us! To start, we were accepted into the
[Y Combinator 2023 winter batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/moonrepo), which was
extremely unexpected, but very much welcome. The 3 months we spent in YC was quite eye opening, as
we learned so much about the industry, and how to move forward. We spent those 3 months really
diving into what we want to build and deliver, and after much trial and error, and many failed
prototypes, we chose to move forward with launching [proto][proto] as its own tool, improving
[moon][moon], and slowing down development of [moonbase][moonbase] (outside of remote caching).

### moon

For [moon][moon], we officially launched v1 back in March, and celebrated its 2 year birthday in
October. Over the course of 2023, we released 23 minor versions, jam packed with new features such
as:

- Action and project graphs improvements
- Bun tier 1, 2, and 3 support
- Canary & nightly releases
- Code ownership (`CODEOWNERS`)
- Configuration rewrite (using our [schematic](https://github.com/moonrepo/schematic) crate)
- Deno tier 1 and 2 support
- Developer experience improvements
- Documentation polish
- Experiments
- Interactive & persistent tasks
- JavaScript and TypeScript improvements
- Onboarding flow improvements
- `PATH` based task execution
- [proto][proto] integration
- Query language
- [Railway](https://railway.app/) support
- Rust tier 1, 2, and 3 support
- Tagging and boundaries/contraints
- Task extending, inheritance, and configuration enhancements
- Task dependencies configurations
- Toolchain enhancements
- VCS (Git) hooks
- ... and much much more!

However, when looking at our [2023 roadmap](./2023-roadmap), there are a few items we failed to
deliver on. The biggest are additional languages, better tier support, and release workflows. We
ultimately didn't land these features as we plan to move to a plugin based architecture, and didn't
want to invest too much time into the current implementation.

### moonbase

During YC, we officially launched [moonbase][moonbase], our cloud service that offers remote caching
to all moon users (and also includes a free tier). Over the next few months, we continued to improve
the service, by adding basic insights into CI runs (powered by [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci)), and
overall stability.

However, we unfortunately made the decision to pause development of new features for moonbase, as we
were unsure of the value that they would provide to end-users compared to the cost it would take to
build & maintain. Some such features include code and project ownership, project registry, and
repository health scores. We may revisit this in the future.

### proto

As for [proto][proto], it's been an exciting year. For context, proto's implementation was
originally built into moon directly, and powered
[moon's integrated toolchain](/docs/concepts/toolchain). We strongly felt this functionality can be
useful as a stand-alone tool, as tool installation and developer environment setup is still a major
pain point for developers.

So we decided to extract it out into its own tool, and thus proto was born. Since then, we've
released 27 minor versions with:

- Additional language support: Go, Python
- Binary symlinking
- Canary & nightly releases
- Detection improvements
- Directory-level configuration
- Deeper shell integration
- Global packages
- Native shim executables
- Runtime version detection
- WASM and TOML based plugins
- ... and more to come!

## Launching moon v2

It's been almost a year since we launched v1, and we believe we're ready to start planning out and
working on v2. Our goal for major releases is to introduce breaking changes in the most seamless way
possible, and to do so, we plan to incrementally land internal changes in v1 in preparation for v2,
provide codemods for migrating configuration, and of course, provide an in-depth migration guide.

In order of importance, we plan to land the following changes. This list does not include features
that will [land after v2](#post-launch-features).

- Move to a [plugin based architecture](#plugin-based-architecture)
- Rename and standardize some configuration settings
- Removed deprecated features

It's a short list but also a ton of work. We have no ETA on when this will land exactly.

### Plugin based architecture

The biggest change and primary focus for v2 is to move to a WASM plugin based architecture (for
language integration). Based on our work with [proto's plugins](/docs/proto/plugins), we have a very
good idea of how we would model this for moon, and a new love for WASM based plugins (powered by
[Extism](https://extism.org/)).

One of the leading factors for this decision, is that building everything into Rust directly is not
scalable, is a maintenance headache, and is also extremely difficult. It results in a lot of
duplicated code, increased compilation times, and a lot of complexity. By moving to plugins, we can
ditch most of this, and in the grand scheme of things, plugin integration is simply function calls.

Of course there are a handful of additional benefits that come from plugins:

- Enables the community to build and share their own plugins (additional languages).
- Plugins can be individually updated, versioned, and released. Less moon patches.
- Reduces moon's compilation times, as plugins live in their own repositories.
- Easier to contribute to, as moon's codebase is quite complex.

### Post-launch features

Curious what kind of features we have planned for after v2? Of course you are! This isn't an
exhaustive or detailed list, but is top of mind:

- Additional languages support (will be much easier with a plugin system)
- Release workflows (versioning, publishing, changelogs, etc)
- System dependencies within the toolchain
- Language dependency management tools
- Repository and project health scores
- Improved action graph and pipeline
