Happy new year! Let's start 2024 by reflecting on last year and diving into our tentative year long
roadmap.

## Year 2023 in review

Last year was an extremely exciting year for us! To start, we were accepted into the
[Y Combinator 2023 winter batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/moonrepo), which was
extremely unexpected, but very much welcome. The 3 months we spent in YC was quite eye opening, as
we learned so much about the industry, and how to move forward. We spent those 3 months really
diving into what we want to build and deliver, and after much trial and error, and many failed
prototypes, we chose to move forward with launching [proto][proto] as its own tool, improving
[moon][moon], and slowing down development of [moonbase][moonbase] (outside of remote caching).

### moon

For [moon][moon], we officially launched v1 back in March, and celebrated its 2 year birthday in
October. Over the course of 2023, we released 23 minor versions, jam packed with new features such
as:

- Action and project graphs improvements
- Bun tier 1, 2, and 3 support
- Canary & nightly releases
- Code ownership (`CODEOWNERS`)
- Configuration rewrite (using our [schematic](https://github.com/moonrepo/schematic) crate)
- Deno tier 1 and 2 support
- Developer experience improvements
- Documentation polish
- Experiments
- Interactive & persistent tasks
- JavaScript and TypeScript improvements
- Onboarding flow improvements
- `PATH` based task execution
- [proto][proto] integration
- Query language
- [Railway](https://railway.app/) support
- Rust tier 1, 2, and 3 support
- Tagging and boundaries/contraints
- Task extending, inheritance, and configuration enhancements
- Task dependencies configurations
- Toolchain enhancements
- VCS (Git) hooks
- ... and much much more!

However, when looking at our [2023 roadmap](./2023-roadmap), there are a few items we failed to
deliver on. The biggest are additional languages, better tier support, and release workflows. We
ultimately didn't land these features as we plan to move to a plugin based architecture, and didn't
want to invest too much time into the current implementation.

### moonbase

During YC, we officially launched [moonbase][moonbase], our cloud service that offers remote caching
to all moon users (and also includes a free tier). Over the next few months, we continued to improve
the service, by adding basic insights into CI runs (powered by [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci)), and
overall stability.

However, we unfortunately made the decision to pause development of new features for moonbase, as we
were unsure of the value that they would provide to end-users compared to the cost it would take to
build & maintain. Some such features include code and project ownership, project registry, and
repository health scores. We may revisit this in the future.

### proto

As for [proto][proto], it's been an exciting year. For context, proto's implementation was
originally built into moon directly, and powered
[moon's integrated toolchain](/docs/concepts/toolchain). We strongly felt this functionality can be
useful as a stand-alone tool, as tool installation and developer environment setup is still a major
pain point for developers.

So we decided to extract it out into its own tool, and thus proto was born. Since then, we've
released 27 minor versions with:

- Additional language support: Go, Python
- Binary symlinking
- Canary & nightly releases
- Detection improvements
- Directory-level configuration
- Deeper shell integration
- Global packages
- Native shim executables
- Runtime version detection
- WASM and TOML based plugins
- ... and more to come!
