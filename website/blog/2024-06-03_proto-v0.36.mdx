This is a light release that adds support for more terminal shells.

## New static registry

Our long-term plan for proto is to provide a server-based registry in which users could publish and
manage plugins, and immediately make them available to the community. However, this is quite a
mountain of work, and will take some time, but making plugins available _now_ is a priority.

As a temporary solution, we're introducing a static registry, in which available plugins are defined
in static JSON files, located in the official
[moonrepo/proto](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/tree/master/registry) repository. This will help
unblock new feature moving forward.

## New `proto plugin search` command

## New `proto unpin` command

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.36.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Updated `proto uninstall` to also remove entries from `.prototools` if the version was
  uninstalled.
- Updated some error messages to include copy for work arounds.
