## Resolved experiments

moon has a concept of [experiments](/docs/config/workspace#experiments), where certain features are
gated behind a flag. This allows us to support new and old functionality in parallel, and also allow
users to gradually upgrade when encountering a breaking change. For many months now, we've had 2
experiments running, and have decided on a path forward.

The first is `experiments.interweavedTaskInheritance`, which would inherit global and local tasks in
order, interweaved within each other. The old implementation would inherit global first, then local
second, distinctly grouping them. Since this experiment was introduced, we have not received a
single bug report or issue. This is a good sign that the new behavior is working as expected, and as
such, have decided _to move forward_ with this experiment and make it the new implementation. The
old implementation has been removed entirely.

The second is `experiments.taskOutputBoundaries`, which was rather controversial when introduced.
This experiment would trigger an error anytime a [task's `outputs`][outputs] overlapped within
another [task's `outputs`][outputs]. The reason for this change, is that multiple tasks writing to
the same output location could "corrupt" the expected state, and trigger unexpected results when
hydrating from the cache. However in practice, this restriction has caused more headache and
introduced a steeper learning curve then expected. It also caused problems with
[tasks that extend](/docs/config/project#extends) from another, resulting in the same outputs being
used. Because of this, we've decided _to **not** move forward_ with this experiment, and allow
whatever task outputs you wish (we trust you're smart enough to not shoot yourself in the foot).
