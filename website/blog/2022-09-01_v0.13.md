With this release, we've landed some improvements to our smart hashing, and paved the road for
additional languagues.

## Improved hashing accuracy

Our [smart hashing layer](../docs/concepts/cache#hashing) is pretty powerful, but was not entirely
accurate. Up until now, when hashing a Node.js project, we'd include the `dependencies`,
`devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` versions located within the project's `package.json` as
hash inputs. This was great, because if a dependency was explicitly upgraded in the `package.json`,
it would invalidate the previous hashes as the version number changed.

However, what if the dependency was implicitly upgraded by another project, but the `package.json`
was not modified? These kind of transitive changes were currently ignored by moon, but no longer, as
moon will now resolve all `package.json` dependencies to the resolved version found in the root
lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc)!

At moon, we believe in providing consumers with the ability to configure to their needs, and as
such, have added a new [`hasher`](../docs/config/workspace#hasher) setting to
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace). This setting will allow you to choose between the
2 hashing patterns above!

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.13.0) for a
full list of changes.

- The runner will now fail with an error if a task has defined `outputs` but an output was not
  created after the task is executed. This change was made so that artifacts are deterministic.
- The `actionRunner` setting in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace) was renamed to
  `runner`.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the next v0.14 release!

- A `moon new` command to generate new projects, files, scaffolding, and more from pre-defined
  templates.
- Implicit dependency discovery. Moon will now scan manifest files and determine project
  relationships.
