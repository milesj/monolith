With this release, we've landed some improvements to our smart hashing, and paved the road for
additional languagues.

## Improved hashing accuracy

Our [smart hashing layer](../docs/concepts/cache#hashing) is pretty powerful, but was not entirely
accurate. Up until now, when hashing a Node.js project, we'd include the `dependencies`,
`devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` versions located within the project's `package.json` as
hash inputs. This was great, because if a dependency was explicitly upgraded in the `package.json`,
it would invalidate the previous hashes as the version number changed.

However, what if the dependency was implicitly upgraded by another project, but the `package.json`
was not modified? These kind of transitive changes were currently ignored by moon, but no longer, as
moon will now resolve all `package.json` dependencies to the resolved version found in the root
lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc)!

At moon, we believe in providing consumers with the ability to configure to their needs, and as
such, have added a new [`hasher`](../docs/config/workspace#hasher) setting to
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace). This setting will allow you to choose between the
2 hashing patterns above!
