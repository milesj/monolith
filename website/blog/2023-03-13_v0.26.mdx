## New `moon docker setup` command

moon has provided [built-in `Dockerfile` support](/docs/guides/docker) since v0.15 (11 versions
ago!) and we've always encouraged the use of the [`moon setup`](/docs/commands/setup) command to
setup the toolchain and install project dependencies. Here's an example of a moon powered
`Dockerfile`:

```docker
FROM node:latest
WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

# Copy workspace skeleton
COPY ./.moon/docker/workspace .

# Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon setup

# Copy source files
COPY ./.moon/docker/sources .

# Build something
RUN moon run app:build

# Prune workspace
RUN moon docker prune

CMD ["moon", "run", "app:start"]
```

However, over the course of these 11 releases since v0.15, we refactored the `moon setup` command to
only setup the toolchain, and _no longer_ install project dependencies. We inadvertently broke our
Docker integration. This was an oversight on our part.

To rectify this situation, we're introducing a new
[`moon docker setup`](/docs/commands/docker/setup) command that will efficiently install
dependencies for projects focused/affected within the `Dockerfile`. This is a much better solution
than before, and you should see improved Docker layer caching!

```diff
-RUN moon setup
+RUN moon docker setup
```
