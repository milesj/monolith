Today we've got a small release that includes some helpful features.

<!--truncate-->

## New `proto pin` command

Before our official v1 release, which is relatively soon, we'll be making some breaking changes with
the proto APIs. The first is the introduction of the new [`proto pin`](/docs/proto/commands/pin)
command, which replaces the previous `proto local` and `proto global` commands. We felt this was a
much cleaner change, and far easier to understand that the previous command names.

```shell
# v0.18
$ proto global node 20
$ proto local go 1.20

# v0.19+
$ proto pin node 20 --global
$ proto pin go 1.20
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.19.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `PROTO_WASM_LOG` environment variable to toggle the logging of messages from Extism and WASM
  plugins. Useful for debugging.
- Updated `proto install` to auto-clean stale plugins after a successful installation.
