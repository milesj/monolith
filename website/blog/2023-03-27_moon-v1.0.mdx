## New date/time token variables

[Tokens](/docs/concepts/token) are a mechanism used in task configuration for dynamically injecting
values from the current project or task, especially when task inheritance is involved. Tokens have
existed since moon's inception, without much change... until now.

We're excited to introduce a new set of tokens for referencing the
[current date or time](/docs/concepts/token#datetime): `$date`, `$time`, `$datetime`, and
`$timestamp`. With these new tokens, you're now able to implement clever or unusual solutions, like
grouping builds or deploys based on the current timestamp.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  deploy: 'app deploy --output ./build/$timestamp'
```
