## Project tagging

Everyone is familiar with the concept of tagging, and moon's implementation is no different. Tags
are a simple mechanism for categorizing projects, and can be defined through the
[`tags`](/docs/config/project#tags) setting in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tags:
  - 'react'
  - 'prisma'
```

Tags can be used to group projects together for easier querying, enforcing of project boundaries,
applying constraints, and more in the future. Tags will become a staple for maintaining repositories
at scale. Continue reading for more information!

### Querying projects by tag

The first integration with tags is project querying. You can now query for projects by tag using the
new `--tags` option in the [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) command. For
example, say you want to find all projects that are tagged with `vue` or `trpc`:

```shell
$ moon query projects --tags 'vue|trpc'
```

## Environment variable substitution

moon supports granular environment variables through the project-level
[`env`](/docs/config/project#env) setting, task-level [`env`](/docs/config/project#env-1) setting,
and the task [`envFile`](/docs/config/project#envfile) option. We're expanding their functionality
with variable substitution, allowing the value of another environment variable to be interpolated
using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. This is especially useful for composing complex environment
variables.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'app start'
    env:
      APP_TARGET: '${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}'
```

The same substitution syntax can also be used within `.env` files.

```toml title=".env"
APP_TARGET="${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}"
```

## Date/time token variables

[Tokens](/docs/concepts/token) are a mechanism used in task configuration for dynamically injecting
values from the current project or task, especially when task inheritance is involved. Tokens have
existed since moon's inception, without much change... until now.

We're excited to introduce a new set of tokens for referencing the
[current date or time](/docs/concepts/token#datetime): `$date`, `$time`, `$datetime`, and
`$timestamp`. With these new tokens, you're now able to implement clever or unusual solutions, like
grouping builds or deploys based on the current timestamp.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  deploy:
    command: 'app deploy --output ./build/$timestamp'
```
