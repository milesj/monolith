## Configuration rewrite

If you've ever written Rust before, you may be familiar with the state of configuration crates in
the ecosystem. There's only 2 viable choices to choose from, and we've been using 1 of them.
However, it's been a constant source of friction for our use cases, and didn't support features that
we've needed (built-in validation, file extending, and more).

After researching our options, and attempting to contribute upstream, we decided to build our own
configuration solution, unique to moonrepo's projects. As such, we're excited to announce
[schematic](https://github.com/moonrepo/schematic), the most powerful configuration crate in the
Rust ecosystem, with built-in features like:

- Strict parsing with serde (serilization, deserialization).
- Code frames in errors (when applicable).
- Source file/URL extending.
- Partial file parsing and merging.
- Field-level merge strategies.
- Recursive validation.
- Dynamic default and env var values.
- And much more!

We've spent the last few weeks building this crate from the ground up, and migrating the moon
codebase to it. It's been quite a feat, but we're very excited for what it has to offer already, and
what's to come!

### Strict parsing

When we fail to parse a configuration file, we now include a descriptive message of the failure, and
the file that failed to parse. Typically this will be for unknown fields and invalid value types.

<Image src={require('./img/moon/v1.7/parse-type.png')} width="90%" />

### Recursive validation

Previously when validation would fail, we'd return on the first error and ignore subsequent errors.
This is a non-ideal experience as you'd have to constantly run `moon` commands until all validation
issues have been resolved.

Now we aggregate all validation errors, even from deeply nested fields, and present them together.

### What's next?

Since [schematic](https://github.com/moonrepo/schematic) is very young, and it hasn't been tested
heavily in the ecosystem, we expect bugs and weird edge cases to popup. If you encounter any issues,
please report them immediately so that we can fix them as soon as possible!

With that being said, we'll continue to improve parsing, error messages, and unique functionality,
like code frames within errors. Here's an example for a basic JSON file.
