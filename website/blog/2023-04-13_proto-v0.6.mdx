With this release, we're expanding on our global binary support and providing quality of life
improvements.

## Cleaning stale and unused tools

Is your `~/.proto` installation growing out of control? Are there old versions of tools that you
don't use anymore? Or versions you never used? Unsure if you're using a tool at all or still need
it?

To help avoid these questions and problems, we're introducing a new command that will uninstall
stale and unused tools, [`proto clean`](/docs/proto/commands/clean). When ran, the command will
launch an interactive session and scan the file system for old tools, prompting you to remove them.

```shell
$ proto clean
```

By default the command will uninstall tools that haven't been used in over 30 days, but this can be
customized with the `--days` option.

:::info

Tools installed before v0.6 will most likely be considered stale, as we weren't tracking install and
last used timestamps. However, everything will work as intended after running a tool or simply
moving forward from this point.

## Global binary improvements

In our [previous release](./proto-v0.5), we announced the
[`proto install-global`](/docs/proto/commands/install-global) command for installing global
dependencies that are unique per tool. Thanks to the community, this command has been updated to
support installing multiple globals at once!

```shell
$ proto install-global node typescript webpack-cli
```

On top of this, we're also introducing another command that was requested by the community,
[`proto list-global`](/docs/proto/commands/list-global), that can be used to list all currently
installed globals.

```shell
$ proto list-global node
tsc - ~/.proto/tools/node/globals/lib/node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc
tsserver - ~/.proto/tools/node/globals/lib/node_modules/typescript/bin/tsserver
```

## Better error messages

We've spent most of the past week working on a new internal architecture called
[Starbase](https://github.com/moonrepo/starbase), which will be the new foundation for proto and
moon moving forward. One of the major benefits of this new architecture is a rewritten error system
that provides more context and better error messages.

Here's an example of this, albeit with a contrived situation:
