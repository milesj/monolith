## Extending sibling or inherited tasks

Three months ago, we posted an
[RFC on how to support task extending / task variants](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/849).
On paper this doesn't sound like a hard problem to solve, but internally it would of been an uphill
battle to implement. Thanks to previous releases from the past few months, and the rewrite of the
project graph, task builder, and more, this implementation was a breeze. To finalize the RFC, we
went with option 2, by adding a new `extends` field to task configurations.

With this new addition, we can now rewrite this old configuration, which was needlessly
repetitive...

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint .'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'

  lint-fix:
    command: 'eslint . --fix'
    local: true
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'
```

Into the following configuration.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint .'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'

  lint-fix:
    extends: 'lint'
    args: '--fix'
    local: true
```

We're very happy with this solution, as it's far more readable, maintainable, and doesn't introduce
yet another paradigm to learn. Our goal was to be as familiar as possible, while providing extensive
functionality behind the scenes, which we believe to have achieved.

Some other interesting facts around task extending:

- When extending a task, [merge strategies](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) are
  applied in a similar fashion to inheritance.
- Inherited tasks can be extended from by project-level tasks.
- It's possible to create multiple extended chains.

## Tokens in enviroment variables

Up until now, [token functions and variables](/docs/concepts/token) were only supported in task
commands, args, inputs, and outputs, but not environment variables... why? Honestly, there was no
real reason they weren't supported, it simply never crossed our mind! But thanks to requests from
the community, both token functions and variables are now supported in task
[`env`](/docs/config/project#env-1).

This is great for propagating moon values to other systems. For example, say you want to use moon
project names for Sentry, keeping a 1:1 mapping.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  start:
    command: 'run-server'
    env:
      SENTRY_PROJECT: '$project'
```

If you're familiar with tokens, you may be asking yourself, "How do token functions work since they
expand to a list of paths?" That's a great question! When token functions are used in an environment
variable, like `@group(sources)`, the list of paths will be joined with a comma (`,`).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    env:
      SRCS: '@group(sources)'
```

Since the environment variable is simply a string, you could parse it with your language of choice
to extract the list of paths.

```js
const paths = process.env.SRCS.split(',');
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.12.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Updated task `outputs` to support negated globs.
- Will now log a warning to the console if a configuration file uses the `.yaml` extension.
