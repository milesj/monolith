## Extending sibling or inherited tasks

Three months ago, we posted an
[RFC on how to support task extending / task variants](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/849).
On paper this doesn't sound like a hard problem to solve, but internally it would of been an uphill
battle to implement. Thanks to previous releases from the past few months, and the rewrite of the
project graph, task builder, and more, this implementation was a breeze. To finalize the RFC, we
went with option 2, by adding a new `extends` field to task configurations.

With this new addition, we can now rewrite this old configuration, which was needlessly
repetitive...

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint .'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'

  lint-fix:
    command: 'eslint . --fix'
    local: true
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'
```

Into the following configuration.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint .'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
      - '*.js'
      - '.eslintrc.js'
      - 'tsconfig.json'
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      - '/tsconfig.eslint.json'
      - '/tsconfig.options.json'

  lint-fix:
    extends: 'lint'
    args: '--fix'
    local: true
```

We're very happy with this solution, as it's far more readable, maintainable, and doesn't introduce
yet another paradigm to learn. Our goal was to be as familiar as possible, while providing extensive
functionality behind the scenes, which we believe to have achieved.

Some other interesting facts around task extending:

- When extending a task, [merge strategies](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) are
  applied in a similar fashion to inheritance.
- Inherited tasks can be extended from by project-level tasks.
- It's possible to create multiple extended chains.
