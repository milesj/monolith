## Customize the project name in `moon.yml`

This has been a long requested feature, but thanks to the project graph rework and improvements over
the last few releases, this is now possible. In [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project), you can now
configure the [`id`](/docs/config/project#id) setting to override the project name (identifier)
derived from [`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects) in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace) (most applicable to glob based project locations).

For example, say we have the following `projects` glob.

```yml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

By default, the project folder name becomes the project name. For the most part this is fine, but
what if you have a very large monorepo? Or have conflicting project names? Or are migrating
projects? It becomes difficult to manage and organize. But now, simply configure `id`!

```yml title="<project>/moon.yml"
id: 'custom-project-name'
```

:::info

Be sure that all targets, project dependencies, task dependencies, and other references are using
the new identifier, otherwise an error will be triggered!
