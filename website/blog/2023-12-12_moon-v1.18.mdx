## New path based task execution

Since moon's inception, before we would execute a task's command, we would locate its executable on
the file system and execute it directly. We went with this approach as we wanted to avoid all of the
baggage and "unknown behavior" that came with executing through a shell, and to ensure a more
deterministic outcome. This approach worked very well for stand-alone binaries, like `node`,
`cargo`, and built-in commands like `rm`, `mkdir`, and `git`.

However, it was very problematic in 2 scenarios: executables from language dependencies (node
modules, etc), and multi-command based tasks (using `&&`). To remedy this situation, we're no longer
locating the executables ourselves, and instead are prepending `PATH` with the locations in which we
know these executables should exist. We're also loosening the restriction on the
[`shell` task option](/docs/config/project#shell), which can now be enabled for _all_ tasks, not
just system tasks.

### Dependency executables

For the 1st scenario, let's talk about Node.js modules. When we encountered an unknown task command,
like `eslint` or `prettier`, we'd attempt to locate its executable by traversing `node_modules/.bin`
directories, parsing Bash/PowerShell scripts, resolving the source `.js` files, and finally
executing with `node`. To demonstrate this, say you had the following task:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier --write .'
```

When finally executed, internally it would become something like this command.

```shell
~/.proto/tools/node/<version>/bin/node ../../node_modules/prettier/internal/cli.mjs --write .
```

This was required since our runtime is Rust and we don't have access to Node.js's module resolution
algorithm... but this approach was very brittle and error prone. It took us many releases to iron
out all the bugs, and we're pretty sure there are still edge cases unaccounted for.

### What's next?

In the future, we'll continue to expand on this functionality, and our ultimate goal is to remove
the concept of `platform` from tasks, which has been a bit confusing for new users.

## Customize the project name in `moon.yml`

This has been a long requested feature, but thanks to the project graph rework and improvements over
the last few releases, this is now possible. In [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project), you can now
configure the [`id`](/docs/config/project#id) setting to override the project name (identifier)
derived from [`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects) in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace) (most applicable to glob based project locations).

For example, say we have the following `projects` glob.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

By default, the project folder name becomes the project name. For the most part this is fine, but
what if you have a very large monorepo? Or have conflicting project names? Or are migrating
projects? It becomes difficult to manage and organize. But now, simply configure `id`!

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
id: 'custom-project-name'
```

:::info

Be sure that all targets, project dependencies, task dependencies, and other references are using
the new identifier, otherwise an error will be triggered!
