After many months of design and development, we're finally introducing MQL, our own unique query
language!

<!--truncate-->

## Updated `moon query` commands to support MQL

Last week we announced [MQL](./moon-v1.3#run-targets-based-on-a-query), a custom query language for
applying filters to moon's project graph, primarily through the [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run)
command. We plan to slowly integrate MQL throughout moon as it provides an easy to use API, and an
overall better developer experience.

As such, we've updated both [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) and
[`moon query tasks`](/docs/commands/query/tasks) to support MQL statements as an optional first
argument. Totally makes sense that query commands would support MQL!

```shell
# Find all projects with a `lint` or `build` task
$ moon query projects "task=[lint,build]"

# Find all tasks with an id that starts with "dev"
$ moon query tasks "task~dev-*"
```
