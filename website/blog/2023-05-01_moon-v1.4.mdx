## Run targets by tag with `#tag:task`

We love our community, as you all continuously suggest new and awesome features that haven't crossed
our minds. One such feature was the ability to run tasks for all projects with a tag,
[suggested by @theoephraim](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues/803), which is now possible with
the new [tag scope](/docs/concepts/target#by-tag), `#tag:task`.

As an example, we can easily lint all projects that have the `frontend` tag.

```shell
$ moon run '#frontend:lint'
```

> Because `#` is special syntax and denotes a comment, the target will need to be quoted to work
> correctly!

## Updated `moon query` commands to support MQL

Last week we announced [MQL](./moon-v1.3#run-targets-based-on-a-query), a custom query language for
applying filters to moon's project graph, primarily through the [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run)
command. We plan to slowly integrate MQL throughout moon as it provides an easy to use API, and an
overall better developer experience.

As such, we've updated both [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) and
[`moon query tasks`](/docs/commands/query/tasks) to support MQL statements as an optional first
argument. Totally makes sense that query commands would support MQL!

```shell
# Find all projects with a `lint` or `build` task
$ moon query projects "task=[lint,build]"

# Find all tasks with an id that starts with "dev"
$ moon query tasks "task~dev-*"
```
