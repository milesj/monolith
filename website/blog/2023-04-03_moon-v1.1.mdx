## Run targets in closest project

The [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) command can run targets in an array of different formats, but
was unable to run targets based on the current working directory. Well no more! You can now run
tasks from the closest project based on file path by omitting `:` from the target name.

```shell
$ cd packages/components

# Runs `components:build` internally
$ moon run build
```

## View resolved task information

Debugging task issues can be a quite a pain, as there can be many points of failure. Are inputs too
greedy? Are outputs not being created? Does it exist at all? To help with this, you can now view
task information by running [`moon task <target>`](/docs/commands/task).

```shell
$ moon task app:build
```

This command will display _resolved_ information, including inherited settings, and path resolved
inputs and outputs. Here's an example:

```
