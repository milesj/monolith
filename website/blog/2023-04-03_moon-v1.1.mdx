# Run targets in closes project

The [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) command can run targets in an array of different formats, but
it was unable to run targets based on the current working directory. Well no more! You can now run
tasks for the closest project based on file path by omitting `:` from the target name.

```shell
$ cd packages/components

# Runs `components:build` internally
$ moon run build
```
