This release implements two long requested features, canary releases and Python.

## Install canary releases

## Experimental Python support

It's been quite a while since we've introduced a new language into proto, and we're excited to
announce the highly requested language, Python! Since Python is now an
[officially supported language](https://github.com/moonrepo/python-plugin), installing Python (and
pip) is as simple as:

```shell
$ proto install python
```

However, we're marking language support as experimental for the time being. We expect our
implementation to work for modern Python versions, but may not work for older versions, especially
Python 2. The reasons for this are as follows:

- proto will install pre-built binaries from
  [indygreg/python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone). This is
  an unofficial project, and _does not_ support all Python versions.
- If [`python-build`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/plugins/python-build/README.md) is
  available, we'll attempt to use it to build + install Python. This currently requires `pyenv` to
  be installed, and _does not_ work on Windows.
- Furthermore, we only support `cpython` at the moment, and do not support `pypy`, `jython`, or
  other Python implementations. It's unknown whether this functionality should be in the core Python
  plugin, or another plugin entirely.

In a future proto version, we want to support a true "build from source" approach for all tools.
Once that functionality has landed, we can properly support Python on all platforms, but until then,
let us know how this works for you!
