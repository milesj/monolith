## Better version detection

One of proto's best features is its [contextual version detection](/docs/proto/detection), but it
did have 1 shortcoming. When we detected a partial version, like `1.2`, we'd resolve to a fully
qualified version with the latest patch version (e.g. `1.2.3`). While this worked in most cases,
everytime a new patch was released upstream (e.g. `1.2.4`), proto would error and require a manual
install of this new version. This was pretty annoying as `1.2.3` and `1.2.4` are likely to be
compatible, and both satisfy the `1.2` version constraint.

To mitigate this scenario, we've updated the version detection to scan the locally installed
versions _first_ when encountering a partial version. This solves the problem above by allowing
`1.2.3` to satisfy the requirement, instead of forcing an install of `1.2.4`.
