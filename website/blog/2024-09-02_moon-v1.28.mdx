## OS specific tasks

When moon was originally designed, it was meant to be a very simple but easily configurable task
runner. But since then, moon has grown drastically, and so has the requirements of its users. One
such request was being able to define tasks that only run for certain operating systems.

This wasn't possible before; but is now thanks to the new
[`os` task option](/docs/config/project#os). This option can be configured with "linux", "macos", or
"windows" to target those specific systems, and can be a single value, or list of values.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  build-linux:
    command: 'cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
    options:
      os: 'linux'
  build-macos:
    command: 'cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin'
    options:
      os: 'macos'
  build-windows:
    command: 'cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc'
    options:
      os: 'windows'
```

When a task is ran on a non-compatible system, it will be converted to a no-operation task, so that
dependency chains still resolve correctly.

> In the future, we will look into supporting system architecture as well.
