With this release, we're landing the first iteration of our notifier service, starting with
webhooks! We've also spent some time working on quality of life improvements.

## Webhook events

Looking to gather metrics for your pipelines? Gain insight into run durations and failures? Maybe
you want to send Slack or Discord notifications? With our new notifier system, this is now possible
through webhooks!

Simply enable the [`notifier.webhookUrl`](../docs/config/workspace#webhookurl) setting to start
receiving events from your CI environments.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
notifier:
  webhookUrl: 'https://api.company.com/some/endpoint'
```

> View the [official guide on webhooks](../docs/guides/webhooks) for a full list of events and an
> example payload structure!
