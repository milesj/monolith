## Project-level task platform

In our previous release, [v0.23](./v0.23#project-level-environment-variables), we added support for
project-level environment variables. This is great as it helps to reduce duplication for projects
with many tasks. On that note, we wondered which configuration field we could apply similar
treatment, and as such, we've added a project-level [`platform`](/docs/config/project#platform)
setting.

When this setting is defined, all task's within the current project that have _not explicitly_
configured their `platform`, will inherit the project-level platform. If neither settings are
defined, we'll attempt to detect the correct platform based on the state of the project.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
# Will set non-explicit task's platform to node
platform: 'node'

tasks:
	# Will be node
  dev: # ...

	# Will be node
  build: # ...

	# Will be system
  serve:
    # ...
    platform: 'system'
```

> This setting is _extremely useful_ for projects that contain multiple languages. Even more so once
> we land Bun and Deno support, as we'll need a way to differentiate JavaScript/TypeScript projects!

## Shell completions

Auto-completion in your terminal increases productivity, which we're a massive fan of. To help
support this, we're introducing the [`moon completions`](/docs/commands/completions) command, which
generates the appropriate command completions for your current shell.

This command writes to stdout, which can then be redirected to a file of your choice. Be sure to
configure your shell profile to load the completions!

```shell
$ moon completions > ~/.bash_completion.d/moon.sh
```
