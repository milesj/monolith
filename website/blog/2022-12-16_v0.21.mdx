## New `--updateCache` command line option

Our caching layer is pretty powerful, as it helps to avoid tasks from running unnecessarily.
However, there are situations where you need to refresh or force update the cache outside of the
[`inputs`](../docs/config/project#inputs) list. This is currently achieved with the
[`--cache`](../docs/commands/overview#caching) option, like `moon --cache off run ...`, but this is
non-ideal for a few reasons:

1. It disables _all caching_, which means dependency installs/dedupes will continually be ran. This
   adds a lot of unwanted overhead.
2. It requires you to backspace in the terminal to add the option _before_ `run` or `check`, as it's
   a global option. A little tedious but important for experience.

So to work around these limitations, we've added a new `--updateCache` (or `-u`) to both
[`moon run`](../docs/commands/run) and [`moon check`](../docs/commands/run), which will bypass
reading any existing cache items, but will force update the cache base on the latest run.

```shell
$ moon run app:build --updateCache
```
