## New `migrate-nx` extension

In our previous release, we added support for [migrating from Turborepo](./moon-v1.21), but what
about Nx? Nx is a very popular build system with many users. A lot of our current moon users were
former Nx users, but unfortunately, they had to go through the tedious process of migrating
everything manually. We wanted to make this process easier for new users, so we created a new
experimental extension to help with this process,
[`migrate-nx`](/docs/guides/extensions#migrate-nx).

```shell
$ moon ext migrate-nx
```

This extension was quite complicated to implement, as Nx has a _ton_ of features. However, when the
extension is executed, we'll convert the root `nx.json` and `workspace.json` files to
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace) and related top-level config files, and we'll also
convert every `project.json` and `package.json` (with an `nx` block) into a
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) file.

Conversion is not a perfect 1:1, as moon and Nx are quite different. Please refer to the
[official documentation](/docs/guides/extensions#migrate-nx) for a list of unsupported settings and
features.

:::info

An awesome feature that didn't make it in time for this release, is an npm package for Nx
compatiblity, that will allow Nx executors/plugins to be executed through moon, without the
requirement of Nx itself. This will allow for a seamless transition from Nx to moon, without the
need to change any of your existing Nx executors/plugins till later.

This functionality will be provided by our new
[`@moonrepo/nx-compat` package](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/tree/master/packages/nx-compat),
which we hope to finish in the coming weeks.
