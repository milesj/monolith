With this release, we've added Rust language support, user configs, and a few other improvements.

## Rust language support

## Custom version aliases

We are excited to announce 2 new commands that enable you to define custom version aliases,
[`proto alias`](/docs/proto/commands/alias) and [`proto unalias`](/docs/proto/commands/unalias).
Aliasing of versions is a feature that allows you to assign a custom name or label to a specific
version of a tool.

For example, instead of using the version number, you can assign a label such as "work" or
"personal" to a version. This makes it easier to remember and manage different versions.

```shell
$ proto alias node work 16.16
$ proto alias node personal 18
```

Aliases can be used anywhere a version is accepted, for example:

```shell
$ proto bin node work
$ proto install node personal
```
