In this release, we've focused on loosening restrictions to improve the overall developer
experience.

## Shorthand for `moon run`

This has been a long requested feature and we're happy to finally deliver it! You can now omit the
"run" keyword for the [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) command, just so long as the first non-option
argument is a target (must contain a `:`).

```shell
# v1.13
$ moon run app:build

# v1.14+
$ moon app:build
```

## Configure partial toolchain versions

Since moon's inception, our integrated toolchain required fully qualified semantic versions
(major.minor.patch) for tools. This was by design to ensure that we could provide a consistent,
reliable, and deterministic experience for all users. This solved the problem of "Is X using the
correct version of Y?".

However, this also meant that we were unable to support partial versions (major.minor) of tools,
which is a common use case and request for many users. Over the last few months, we've made immense
progress in [proto](/proto) on how it parses, resolves, and evaluates versions, known as the version
specification.

We felt the time was right to pull these changes into moon, and as such, all `version` fields in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain) now support partial versions, version
requirements/ranges, and even aliases!

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
  version: '20.7' # ~20.7
  npm:
    version: '^9'

rust:
  version: 'stable'
```

[official version specification documentation](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification).
