# Increased output hydration by 8-10x

In moon, hydration is the concept of unpacking an existing hashed artifact into a
[task's outputs](../docs/config/project#outputs) during a cache hit. In our previous implementation,
we would delete all existing outputs before unpacking the archive to ensure a clean slate and to
avoid stale files. While this worked, it wasn't the most performant, taking about 280ms for 1,000
files (which is still reasonably fast!).

In our new implementation, we now utilize a smart file tree diffing algorithm that will only unpack
files _with different content_, and will automatically remove stale files in the process. This has
resulted in a 10x performance increase, taking about 30ms! Multiply this by many projects, the
results should be very apparent.

We hope you enjoy this improvement, as it's the first of many to come!
