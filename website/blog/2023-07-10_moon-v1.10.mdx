Instead of launching a large feature this release, we're focusing on quality of life and developer
experience improvements.

## Quality improvements

In the past 6 months, we've released over 16 versions of moon, with our official v1.0 release among
them. This is extremely impressive and we're very proud of the progress we've made. To continue this
trend, we'll be starting a new initiative that will land quality of life improvements (instead of
major features) every 6 months, starting with this release!

### Breaking changes

While APIs haven't changed, we have introduced some fixes for edge case that could be considered
breaking, but for the most part, these changes probably won't affect you. With that being said...

The first fix is that tasks configured with the same `outputs` location will now error. This is
extremely problematic for caching and hydration, as multiple tasks all writing to the same output
will inflate the tarball, and cause unwanted side effects. To demonstrate this, the following is now
an error:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'foo build'
    outputs:
      - 'dist'

  compile:
    command: 'bar compile'
    outputs:
      - 'dist'
```

The other fix, which primarily applies to [`moon ci`][ci] and [`moon check`](/docs/commands/check),
is that a target will be skipped if one of its dependencies failed or has also been skipped.
Previously the target would attempt to run and most likely fail since it relied on artifacts from
its dependencies (which don't exist). Another benefit of this change is that runs should be much
faster, as we're not wasting time running targets that we know will fail, which is great for CI.

### Ignore input files

### Customize base and head
