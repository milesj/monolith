## Offline mode

moon assumes that an internet connection is always available, as we download and install tools into
the toolchain, resolve versions against upstream manifests, and automatically install dependencies.
While this is useful, having a constant internet connection isn't always viable.

In this release, we now check for an active internet connection and bypass certain workflows when
applicable.
[Jump to the official guide on offline mode for more information](/docs/guides/offline-mode)!

## Custom project `language`

Project's have always been able to define a [`language`](/docs/config/project#language) in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) that denotes the primary programming language for the project.
Historically this has been a strict enum of supported values, and could _not_ be customized for
other languages. With the introduction of
[language driven task inheritance](./v0.23#new-scoped-tasks-with-moontasksyml), we felt like
revisiting this setting, and as such, you're now able to define _any_ language in this setting,
which also feeds into the task inheritance system.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
language: 'kotlin'
```

With this change, `.moon/tasks/kotlin-application.yml`, `.moon/tasks/dotnet.yml`, and other
variations are now possible! However, besides task inheritance, other functionality like platform
detection, and Dockerfile support are not enabled.

## Project-level TypeScript settings

Our TypeScript integration supports many automated workflows, like syncing project references, and
routing `outDir` to our shared cache. This is wonderful for the majority, but for the handful of
projects where these settings were not viable, there was no simple way to disable or opt out of the
functionality.

Well no more, projects can now override the workspace-level TypeScript settings
`routeOutDirToCache`, `syncProjectReferences`, and `syncProjectReferencesToPaths` through the
[`toolchain.typescript`](/docs/config/project#typescript) setting in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
toolchain:
	typescript:
		routeOutDirToCache: false
```

Because this setting was changed from a boolean to an object, the old pattern of disabling
Typescript must now use the `disabled` setting.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
# Old
toolchain:
	typescript: false

# new
toolchain:
	typescript:
		disabled: true
```
