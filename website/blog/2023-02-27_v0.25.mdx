## Offline mode

moon assumes that an internet connection is always available, as we download and install tools into
the toolchain, resolve versions against upstream manifests, and automatically install dependencies.
While this is useful, having a constant internet connection isn't always viable.

In this release, we now check for an active internet connection and bypass certain workflows when
applicable.
