With this release, we're landing Deno, our first supported language besides Node.js, and improving
interoperability of languages as a whole.

## Experimental Deno tier 2 support

Three months ago we announced our [new tiered support structure](./v0.21) for languages, and as of
today, we're happy to announce that our second language to reach tier 2 is
[Deno](https://deno.land)! With tier 2 support, we now analyze Deno specific configuration files
(like `deno.json`) to infer dependencies and relationships, as well as utilize this information for
inputs and hashing purposes. With that being said, we're marking this release as experimental until
we fine tune the implementation, and iron out all the bugs.

To get started with using Deno, enable the new [`deno`](/docs/config/toolchain#deno) setting in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain). At this time, we don't have many settings to
configure, so simply defining an empty object is enough to enable the Deno platform! Learn more
about this in our [Deno handbook](/docs/guides/javascript/deno-handbook).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
deno: {}
```

Once enabled, you can start using `deno` commands in your moon tasks. moon will automatically set
the [`platform`](/docs/config/project#platform-1) to "deno" when using a deno command.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
	format:
		command: 'deno fmt'
```

:::info

Because this is only tier 2 support, moon _does not_ download and install Deno into its toolchain.
moon expects the `deno` binary to exist in the current environment.

:::

Furthermore, if you're working a project that is composed of multiple JavaScript runtimes, like
Deno, Bun, or Node.js, you can set the default `platform` for all tasks at the project-level.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
platform: 'deno'
language: 'typescript'
type: 'application'
```

We're very excited for this release as it paves the way for future language integrations, and
enables additional JavaScript runtimes!

## CI insights in moonbase

TODO

## Offline mode

moon assumes that an internet connection is always available, as we download and install tools into
the toolchain, resolve versions against upstream manifests, and automatically install dependencies.
While this is useful, having a constant internet connection isn't always viable.

In this release, we now check for an active internet connection and bypass certain workflows when
applicable.
[Jump to the official guide on offline mode for more information](/docs/guides/offline-mode)!

## Custom project `language`

Project's have always been able to define a [`language`](/docs/config/project#language) in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) that denotes the primary programming language for the project.
Historically this has been a strict enum of supported values, and could _not_ be customized for
other languages. With the introduction of
[language driven task inheritance](./v0.23#new-scoped-tasks-with-moontasksyml), we felt like
revisiting this setting, and as such, you're now able to define _any_ language in this setting,
which also feeds into the task inheritance system.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
language: 'kotlin'
```

With this change, `.moon/tasks/kotlin-application.yml`, `.moon/tasks/dotnet.yml`, and other
variations are now possible! However, besides task inheritance, other functionality like platform
detection, and Dockerfile support are not enabled.

## Project-level TypeScript settings (breaking)

Our TypeScript integration supports many automated workflows, like syncing project references, and
routing `outDir` to our shared cache. This is wonderful for the majority, but for the handful of
projects where these settings were not viable, there was no simple way to disable or opt out of the
functionality.

Well no more, projects can now override the workspace-level TypeScript settings
`routeOutDirToCache`, `syncProjectReferences`, and `syncProjectReferencesToPaths` through the
[`toolchain.typescript`](/docs/config/project#typescript) setting in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
toolchain:
	typescript:
		routeOutDirToCache: false
```

Because this setting was changed from a boolean to an object, the old pattern of disabling
Typescript must now use the `disabled` setting.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
# Old
toolchain:
	typescript: false

# new
toolchain:
	typescript:
		disabled: true
```

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.25.0) for a
full list of changes.

- Updated project, task, and target identifiers to support periods (`.`).
- Refactored glob matching to use workspace relative paths instead of absolute. Please report an
  issue if hashing or affected detection is now inaccurate.
- We now build against older operating systems in an attempt to solve GLIBC version errors.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.26 release!

- Officially release proto!
- Improved Deno interoperability.
- Deno tier 3 support (hopefully).
