## Offline mode

moon assumes that an internet connection is always available, as we download and install tools into
the toolchain, resolve versions against upstream manifests, and automatically install dependencies.
While this is useful, having a constant internet connection isn't always viable.

In this release, we now check for an active internet connection and bypass certain workflows when
applicable.
[Jump to the official guide on offline mode for more information](/docs/guides/offline-mode)!

## Project-level TypeScript settings

Our TypeScript integration supports many automated workflows, like syncing project references, and
routing `outDir` to our shared cache. This is wonderful for the majority, but for the handful of
projects where these settings were not viable, there was no simple way to disable or opt out of the
functionality.

Well no more, projects can now override the workspace-level TypeScript settings
`routeOutDirToCache`, `syncProjectReferences`, and `syncProjectReferencesToPaths` through the
[`toolchain.typescript`](/docs/config/project#typescript) setting in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
toolchain:
	typescript:
		routeOutDirToCache: false
```

Because this setting was changed from a boolean to an object, the old pattern of disabling
Typescript must now use the `disabled` setting.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
# Old
toolchain:
	typescript: false

# new
toolchain:
	typescript:
		disabled: true
```
