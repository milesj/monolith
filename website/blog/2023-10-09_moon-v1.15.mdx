## Now supported in Railway

If you're a big fan of [Railway](https://railway.app/) (like we are), and you're deploying a Node.js
backed application, then you'll be happy to hear that Railway now officially and natively supports
moon! We spent some time over the past month
[integrating moon support into their Nixpacks architecture](https://nixpacks.com/docs/providers/node).

To make use of this, set the `NIXPACKS_MOON_APP_NAME` environment variable to the name of your moon
project that you want to be deployed. This will then automatically run `moon run <app>:build` and
`moon run <app>:start` respectively. To customize the task names, you can set the
`NIXPACKS_MOON_BUILD_TASK` and `NIXPACKS_MOON_START_TASK` environment variables.

:::info

This is currently only supported for Node.js projects, but will be expanded to other languages in
the future!
