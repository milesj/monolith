## Configure default options for tasks

[Task options](/docs/config/project#options) provide a way to apply granular changes to a task's
behavior when running in the pipeline. However, they can become tedious when you need to apply them
to many tasks, especially when inheritance is involved. To help with this, you can now configure the
[`taskOptions`](/docs/config/tasks#taskoptions) setting in task related configs, like
`.moon/tasks.yml` and `.moon/tasks/*.yml`, which acts as the base/default options for all inherited
tasks.

For example, the following config:

```yaml title=".moon/tasks.yml"
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
      retryCount: 2
  lint:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
      retryCount: 2
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
      retryCount: 2
```

Can simply be rewritten as:

```yaml title=".moon/tasks.yml"
taskOptions:
  outputStyle: 'stream'
  retryCount: 2

tasks:
  build:
    # ...
  lint:
    # ...
  test:
    # ...
```

Because these options are defined at the workspace-level, they adhere to the same merge and
inheritance rules as other settings. Just be aware that these options are inherited first in the
chain, and can be overwritten by other layers, or by project-level tasks.
