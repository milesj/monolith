## Affected files filtering

We've spent a good portion of this release working on affected detection for projects and tasks,
primarily through `--affected`, and have uncovered and fixed a handful of edge cases. With that
being said, we asked ourselves, "How could we improve the developer experience even more"? What
about passing the affected files list to the running task?

And that's exactly what we've done through the new task option
[`affectedFiles`](../docs/config/project#affectedfiles)! This option works in unison with the
`--affected` option, enabling some awesome functionality. Given the following config:

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      affectedFiles: true
```

When we run this task _without_ `--affected`, it will append an argument for the current directory
(`.`). This will lint the entire project.

```shell
# moon run project:lint
eslint .
```

However, when we run this task _with_ `--affected`, and have have touched files in the working tree,
it will now append an argument for each file that matches the task's `inputs`. This will now only
lint the provided files, _instead_ of the entire project.

```shell
# moon run project:lint --affected
eslint ./file.ts ./another/file.ts
```

This functionality is _perfect_ pre-commit hooks, and as such, we've added a
[guide for utilizing this pattern with git hooks](../docs/guides/git-hooks)!
