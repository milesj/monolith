## Affected files filtering

We've spent a good portion of this release working on affected detection for projects and tasks,
primarily through `--affected`, and have uncovered and fixed a handful of edge cases. With that
being said, we asked ourselves, "How could we improve the developer experience even more"? What
about passing the affected files list to the running task?

And that's exactly what we've done through the new task option
[`affectedFiles`](../docs/config/project#affectedfiles)! This option works in unison with the
`--affected` option, enabling some awesome functionality. Given the following config:

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      affectedFiles: true
```

When we run this task _without_ `--affected`, it will append an argument for the current directory
(`.`). This will lint the entire project.

```shell
# moon run project:lint
eslint .
```

However, when we run this task _with_ `--affected`, and have have touched files in the working tree,
it will now append an argument for each file that matches the task's `inputs`. This will now only
lint the provided files, _instead_ of the entire project.

```shell
# moon run project:lint --affected
eslint ./file.ts ./another/file.ts
```

This functionality is _perfect_ pre-commit hooks, and as such, we've added a
[guide for utilizing this pattern with git hooks](../docs/guides/git-hooks)!

## Dependency graph optimizations

Our dependency graph determines which targets to run, what tools to install, projects to sync, and
in which order. It's a very complex directed acyclic graph, and has only gotten more complicated
over the year, especially with the introduction of project-level tool overrides.

We decided to rewrite the dependency graph from the ground up to mitigate many of these issues,
optimize nodes and edges, reduce the number of data cloning, and to increase the overall
performance. Everything will still work exactly the same (all of our existing tests passed with no
issue)!

On top of this, we've also migrated the internals of moon to a new hashing algorithm that should see
a 5-10% increase in performance!
