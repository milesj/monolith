In this release, we're excited to introduce extensions, our first type of plugin!

## File groups now support environment variables

Task inputs have supported environment variables for a while now, but file groups have not. The main
reason for this is that file groups were implemented far before environment variables in task
inputs! To bridge this gap, we've added support for environment variables in file groups.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  vite:
    - '...'
    - '$VITE_SECRET_KEY'
    - '$NODE_ENV'

tasks:
  build:
    command: 'vite build'
    inputs:
      - '@group(vite)'
```

Environment variables can be referenced using the
[`@group` token function](/docs/concepts/token#group), or the new
[`@envs` token function](/docs/concepts/token#envs). The latter is only supported for `inputs` and
will error for other locations, while the former is supported in `args`, `inputs`, and `outputs`,
but will filter out environment variables when they are not supported.

## New `migrate-turborepo` extension

In our previous release, we added support for [extensions, a new kind of WASM plugin](./moon-v1.20).
Since this is a new experimental feature, we really wanted to show off what it can do, and stress
test its boundaries. To do that, we chose to migrate the old `moon migrate from-turborepo` command
into an extension
([source can be found here](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon-extensions/tree/master/crates/migrate-turborepo)).
This is our most complex extension so far, as it:

- Loads and parses files on the file system.
- Reads and writes JSON and YAML files.
- Supports deserializing data into structs.
- Extracts project graph information by executing `moon project-graph`.

Do you currently have a Turborepo powered repository? And want to migrate to moon? Then simply
execute the extension as such. View our
[guide for more information](/docs/guides/extensions#migrate-turborepo)!

```shell
$ moon ext migrate-turborepo
```

As part of the migration from moon's Rust core into a WASM plugin, we've added support for the
following new features:

- Added Bun support behind a new `--bun` flag.
- Added support for Turbo's `globalDotEnv`, `dotEnv`, and `outputMode`.
- Added support for root-level tasks (`//#`) through a root `moon.yml`, instead of logging a
  warning.
- Updated migrated task commands to run through a package manager, instead of
  `moon node run-script`.

:::info

Based on the success of this extension, we plan to support a `migrate-nx` extension in the future!
If you'd like to help in this endeavor, let us know!

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.21.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added `bun.inferTasksFromScripts` setting to `.moon/toolchain.yml`, for compatibility with
  Node.js.
- Added a `--quiet` global argument, for hiding non-critical moon output.
- Updated tasks with glob-like arguments to automatically enabled the `shell` option, so that glob
  expansion works correctly.
- Implemented a new buffered console layer for writing to stdout/stderr.
