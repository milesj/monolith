In this release, we're excited to introduce extensions, our first type of plugin!

## New `migrate-turborepo` extension

In our previous release, we added support for [extensions, a new kind of WASM plugin](./moon-v1.20).
Since this is a new experimental feature, we really wanted to show off what it can do, and stress
test its boundaries. To do that, we chose to migrate the old `moon migrate from-turborepo` command
into an extension
([source can be found here](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon-extensions/tree/master/crates/migrate-turborepo)).
This is our most complex extension so far, as it:

- Loads and parses files on the file system.
- Reads and writes JSON and YAML files.
- Supports deserializing data into structs.
- Extracts project graph information by executing `moon project-graph`.

Do you currently have a Turborepo powered repository? And want to migrate to moon? Then simply
execute the extension as such. View our
[guide for more information](/docs/guides/extensions#migrate-turborepo)!

```shell
$ moon ext migrate-turborepo
```

As part of the migration from moon's Rust core into a WASM plugin, we've added support for the
following new features:

- Added Bun support behind a new `--bun` flag.
- Added support for Turbo's `globalDotEnv`, `dotEnv`, and `outputMode`.
- Added support for root-level tasks (`//#`) through a root `moon.yml`, instead of logging a
  warning.
- Updated migrated task commands to run through a package manager, instead of
  `moon node run-script`.

Based on the success of this extension, we plan to support a `migrate-nx` extension in the future!
If you'd like to help in this endeavor, let us know!
