This release adds functionality for managing plugins and purging the proto store.

## Add and remove plugins

## Purge tools and plugins

proto has supported cleaning for quite some time through the
[`proto clean`](/docs/proto/commands/clean) command (and the
[`auto-clean` setting](/docs/proto/config#user-configuration)), which would automatically delete
installed tool versions and temporary files that are older then a specific timeframe. This helps to
free up disk space for unused or rarely used tools.

In this release, we're expanding the `clean` command's functionality with a concept known as
purging, which will "delete entirely". The first being the new `--purge` option, which will delete a
tool, its manifest, _all_ installed versions, and the entire `~/.proto/tools/<id>` directory.

```shell
# Delete all traces of Node.js
$ proto clean --purge node
```

Additionaly, a new `--purge-plugins` option can be used to delete all downloaded plugins (the
`~/.proto/plugins` directory). Useful for house keeping or if you want to start fresh.

```shell
$ proto clean --purge-plugins
```

- Added folder locking during tool installation to avoid colliding processes.
- Renamed `PROTO_ROOT` to `PROTO_HOME`, but we'll support `PROTO_ROOT` for the time being.
