## Bun tier 1, 2, and 3 support

## TypeScript improvements

### Configure the root directory

When moon was first designed, it was designed for JavaScript based monorepos. Because of this, there
were a handful of assumptions that still exist today, one of which is that the moon workspace root
was assumed to be the JavaScript and TypeScript root. The root is extremely important in resolving
relative paths for project references and other path based functionality, so using the workspace
root made the most sense.

However, what if your TypeScript root isn't the workspace root? Or the TypeScript root and
JavaScript root are different? Well, you were out of luck... until now! We're introducing a new
setting called [`typescript.root`](/docs/config/toolchain#root), that denotes the root directory for
TypeScript related functionality (relative from moon's workspace root).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
typescript:
  root: './typescript'
```

### Include shared types

Another common TypeScript practice is to have shared `.d.ts` types that are used across multiple
projects, or to augment third-party types. This is so common that we felt obligated to support it in
some capacity within moon. With that said, we're introducing a new setting,
[`typescript.includeSharedTypes`](/docs/config/toolchain#includesharedtypes).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
typescript:
  includeSharedTypes: true
```

When enabled, we'll automatically sync the shared types path to the `include` field of all relevant
project `tsconfig.json`s. However, for this to work correctly, the shared types _must_ exist in a
`types` folder relative from the [TypeScript root](#configure-the-root-directory).

For example, if the TypeScript root is `/`, and shared types is `/types`, then all packages in
`/packages/*` will be updated with the following:

```json title="packages/example/tsconfig.json"
{
  "include": ["../../types/**/*"]
}
```

> This setting can be overridden on a per-project basis.

### Include sources of project references

Continuing with `include` related functionality, we've introducing yet another new setting,
[`typescript.includeProjectReferenceSources`](/docs/config/toolchain#includeprojectreferencesources),
which does exactly as its name implies. It automatically appends the sources (`**/*`) of all project
references to the `include` field of all relevant project `tsconfig.json`s.

This is useful (and sometimes required) for the following reasons:

- It makes files within a referenced project available for import into the consuming project. This
  is required for "press tab to auto-import" nested/deep files, otherwise only index imports will
  work (and barrel files are costly).
- It also improves the editor experience by making the source files available for intellisense,
  autocomplete, and other features.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
typescript:
  includeProjectReferenceSources: true
```

To understand this functionality, say you have a project with the following `tsconfig.json`, and
this project depends on 2 other projects: ui and utils.

```json title="packages/example/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

When our syncing process occurs, we'll automatically sync project references, and include referenced
sources, like so.

```json title="packages/example/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {},
  "include": ["src/**/*", "../ui/**/*", "../utils/**/*"],
  "references": [{ "path": "../ui" }, { "path": "../utils" }]
}
```

> This setting can also be overridden on a per-project basis.

## JavaScript improvements

### Supporting the "single version policy" pattern

If you're unfamiliar with the single version policy, or the one version rule, it's a pattern that
only allows dependencies to be configured in a single location, typically the root `package.json`.
This pattern forces _all_ projects in a monorepo to use the same dependencies, and avoid the package
`workspaces` functionality.

This pattern was previously not possible in moon, as our automatic dependency installation process
did not account for it, and it would either install in the root if using `workspaces`, or in a
project otherwise. To support this pattern, we're introducing the new setting
[`node.rootPackageOnly`](/docs/config/toolchain#rootpackageonly) for Node.js, and
`bun.rootPackageOnly` for Bun.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
  rootPackageOnly: true
```

When enabled, we'll only install dependencies in the workspace root, regardless of other settings or
how `package.json`s are configured. However, this setting _does not_ verify that other
`package.json`s _do not_ have dependencies. It's up to you to ensure that other `package.json`s do
not have dependencies.
