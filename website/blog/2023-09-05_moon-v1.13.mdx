## Allow tasks to fail

"Allow tasks to fail?" You ask yourself. "Doesn't that defeat the point of a task runner?" You
question further. "You're not wrong!" We reply. These questions assume a perfect repository state,
where all tasks either pass or fail, and there's no middle ground. In reality, very rarely is that
true, and we want to support those stuck in the middle, such as:

- In a heavy migration and it's known that a task is currently broken.
- The task is flaky but you've been unable to find the root cause.
- Upstream dependencies have published a backwards incompatible change, and you're waiting on a fix.
- And of course, in the middle of adopting moon!

For situations where a task consistently or sometimes fails, but you don't want it to fail the
entire pipeline (especially in CI), you can enable the new
[`allowFailure` task option](/docs/config/project#allowfailure).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc --build'
    options:
      allowFailure: true
```

When enabled, failing tasks will no longer bail [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) early, nor will it
exit [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) with a non-zero exit code. However, we still built guard rails
around this feature, as we don't want to encourage bad practices, and one of these guard rails is
that tasks that enable `allowFailure` _cannot_ be depended on by other tasks, as we cannot guarantee
that it's side-effect free.
