## New task runner implementation

TODO

### Fine-grained operations

TODO

### Run summaries

Because of the new task runner and the new console ([below](#new-console-reporting-layer)), we have
the ability to bubble up more information than before. Based on requests from the community, we've
taken the output from [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) and applied it to both
[`moon check`](/docs/commands/check) and [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) behind the `--summary`
flag.

When this flag is passed, we will now summarize all actions that have ran in the pipeline (not just
task related ones), and include failed tasks for review. For example, here's the output of
`moon check website --summary` on moon's repository.

```
$ moon check website --summary

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.25.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Updated external configuration files (via https extends) to be cached for 24 hours.
- Greatly reduced the amount of concurrent locks being held during task execution. May see slight
  performance improvements.
