This is a small release that adds support for uninstalling globals, and improves our WASM APIs.

<!--truncate-->

## Uninstall global dependencies

proto has supported [installing globals since v0.5](./proto-v0.5), but there's been no way to
uninstall an existing global, until now! In this release, we're introducing the
[`proto uninstall-global`](/docs/proto/commands/uninstall-global) command, which will do just that!
The API is exactly the same as its installation counter-part.

```shell
proto install-global node prettier

# On second thought, nevermind...
proto uninstall-global node prettier
```

### WASM functions

Implementing this command was rather straight forward, but most of the work went into supporting
[`install_global` and `uninstall_global`](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#installing-and-uninstalling-globals)
functions for WASM plugins, and then updating all existing plugins! For those of you writing your
own plugins, here's an example of what the Rust code looks like:

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn install_global(
    Json(input): Json<InstallGlobalInput>,
) -> FnResult<Json<InstallGlobalOutput>> {
    let result = exec_command!(inherit, "npm", ["install", "--global", &input.dependency]);

    Ok(Json(InstallGlobalOutput::from_exec_command(result)))
}
```

### TOML setting

We've also updated our TOML plugins to support uninstalling globals through the new
[`globals.uninstall-args`](/docs/proto/toml-plugin#global-packages) setting. Hopefully the name is
self explanatory, but it's a list of arguments passed to the tool's binary, that'll uninstall the
global.

```toml
# ...

[globals]
install-args = ["install", "--global", "{dependency}"]
uninstall-args = ["uninstall", "--global", "{dependency}"]
```

## Improved WASM documentation

With each release we're slowly stabilizing the WASM and TOML APIs for an official v1 release (which
is soon), and with this, it requires more documentation. As part of this release, we've done a giant
polish pass on our WASM documentation, and have included the following sections:

- [Virtual paths](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#virtual-paths)
- [Host environment](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#host-environment)
- [Host functions](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#host-functions)
- [Tool ID and context](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#tool-id-and-context)
- [Installing and uninstalling globals](/docs/proto/wasm-plugin#installing-and-uninstalling-globals)
