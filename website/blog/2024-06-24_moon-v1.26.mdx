In this release, we focused primarily on a next-generation actions pipeline.

## New experimental pipeline

## Generate trace profiles

A major goal of moon is to be extremely efficient and to optimize as much as possible. To help
accomplish this goal, we're introducing the global CLI `--dump` flag, which will generate a trace
profile that can be loaded and reviewed in `chrome://tracing`.

This will display a flame graph with labeled operations, their timing information, and any
associated data. This is the first step in capturing this kind of information, and it will only get
better moving forward.

## Additional shell support

Based on the work in [proto](/proto), we now have built-in support for additional command line
shells. To start, we've updated the [`unixShell`](/docs/config/project#unixshell) and
[`windowsShell`](/docs/config/project#windowsshell) task options to support the following new
shells:

- Unix: `ion`, `nu` (nushell), `pwsh` (powershell), `xonsh`.
- Windows: `elvish`, `fish`, `nu` (nushell), `xonsh`

And furthermore, we've added Nushell completion support to the
[`moon completions`](/docs/commands/completions) command!

## Other changes

of changes.

- Updated CLI command execution to be more performant, and to reduce our usage of concurrent locks.
- Updated proto to v0.37.1 (from v0.36.2).
