## Support for VCS hooks

In our last release, we added support for [code ownership](./moon-v1.8), to better help teams manage
their code review and approval workflows. To continue this trend of "features all companies require
but don't have a good solution for", we're adding support for VCS hooks,
[starting with Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).

If you're unfamiliar with Git hooks, they're a mechanism for running scripts before or after certain
Git events. For example, before a commit is added, before pushing, or after merging. Hooks can be
used for such situations as:

- Ensuring commit messages abide by a certain format.
- Ensuring affected project's source code pass linting and formatting checks.
- Validating configuration files.
- And much more!

### New `vcs` settings

To support hooks, we're introducing the `vcs.hooks` and `vcs.syncHooks` settings to
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace). The former is where you configure the list of
commands to run, grouped by hook type.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
vcs:
  hooks:
    pre-commit:
      - 'pre-commit run'
      - 'moon run :lint --affected'
```

The latter will automatically create and sync hooks with the local VCS checkout, enabling them going
forward. [Learn more about enabling hooks](/docs/guides/vcs-hooks#enabling-hooks), and choosing the
approach that works best for you or your team!

### New `moon sync hooks` command

Although moon can [automatically create](/docs/config/workspace#synchooksonrun) hooks when running a
target, this may be undesirable or abrasive for some developers. Instead, we also support an opt-in
solution through the [`moon sync hooks`](/docs/commands/sync/hooks) command, which will manually
create the hooks.

```shell
$ moon sync hooks
```
