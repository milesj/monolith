With this release, we're announcing not just tier 2, but also tier 3 support for the Rust language.

## New `rust` configurations

Languages in
[moon are enabled through configuration](/docs/how-it-works/languages#enabling-a-language) blocks in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain), and Rust is no different. We now support a
[`rust`](/docs/config/toolchain#rust) toolchain setting, which must be defined to use Rust
([view all available settings](/docs/config/toolchain#rust)).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
rust:
	version: '1.69.0'
```

When the `rust` setting is defined, it will enable the language and
[deep platform integration](/docs/how-it-works/languages#tier-2--platform), and when the `version`
field is defined, it will further enable
[toolchain support](/docs/how-it-works/languages#tier-3--toolchain). Both of these features provide
heavy automation, improving the overall developer experience.

This is fantastic, but what if another Rust project in the monorepo requires a different toolchain
channel/version? If so, they can use the new [`toolchain.rust`](/docs/config/project#rust) setting
in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) to define project-level overrides.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
toolchain:
	rust:
		version: '1.58.0'
```

## New `rust` task platform

## Updated `moon init` commands

## Updated `moon docker` commands
