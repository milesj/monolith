With this release, we're announcing not just tier 2, but also tier 3 support for the Rust language.

## New `rust` configurations

Languages in
[moon are enabled through configuration](/docs/how-it-works/languages#enabling-a-language) blocks in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](/docs/config/toolchain), and Rust is no different. We now support a
[`rust`](/docs/config/toolchain#rust) toolchain setting
([view all available settings](/docs/config/toolchain#rust)).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
rust:
	version: '1.69.0'
```

When the `rust` setting is defined, it will enable the language and
[deep platform integration](/docs/how-it-works/languages#tier-2--platform), and when the `version`
field is defined, it will further enable
[toolchain support](/docs/how-it-works/languages#tier-3--toolchain). Both of these features provide
heavy automation, improving the overall developer experience.

This is fantastic, but what if another Rust project in the monorepo requires a different toolchain
channel/version? If so, they can use the new [`toolchain.rust`](/docs/config/project#rust) setting
in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) to define project-level overrides.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
toolchain:
	rust:
		version: '1.58.0'
```

## New `rust` task platform

## Updated `moon init` command

As part of this release, we've also updated the [`moon init`](/docs/commands/init) command to
support initializing Rust. By default, the command will prompt you on whether to install Rust or
not, otherwise, when `--yes` is passed, the language will be installed if a `Cargo.toml` file is
detected in the destination directory.

If you already have a moon workspace, you can pass `--tool rust` to install Rust into the workspace.

```shell
$ moon init --tool rust
```

## Updated `moon docker` commands

And lastly, we also want to provide a great [`Dockerfile` experience](/docs/guides/docker) when
using Rust. The [`moon docker scaffold`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) command has been updated to
copy `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and other Rust/Cargo related files. When
using Cargo workspaces, nested `Cargo.toml` files are also scaffolded.

```docker
RUN moon docker scaffold rust-app
```

Furthermore, we've also updated the [`moon docker prune`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) command to
remove the entire `target` directory, greatly reducing the size of the image. Pruning makes the
assumption that it's being ran _after_ a release profile has been built.

```docker
RUN moon run rust-app:build-release
RUN moon docker prune
```
