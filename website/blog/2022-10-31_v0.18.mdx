With this release, we've focused heavily on our internals and benchmarking performance metrics, so
it's rather light on new features, but we still have some to show!

## Improved projects configuration

When moon initially launched, it required defining all
[`projects`](../docs/config/workspace#projects) using a map. In v0.3, we added support for globs to
ease the burden of defining many projects. At this point, you had to choose between the 2 patterns,
which wasn't always ideal.

To improve upon this, you can now define a map _and_ globs using a 3rd variation, like so.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  globs:
    - 'apps/*'
    - 'packages/*'
  sources:
    www: 'www'
```

## Define additional `node` arguments

moon manages the Node.js binary in our toolchain, and runs all Node.js based tasks using this
binary, instead of relying on the binary found in the developer's environment. Because of this, how
`node` is executed is abstracted away from end users.

What if you wanted to use an [experimental loader](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#loaders) and
execute TypeScript code at _runtime_? Or to preserve symlinks? Well, you couldn't... but no longer,
as we've added a new setting, [`node.binExecArgs`](../docs/config/workspace#binexecargs), that
allows additional `node` [CLI arguments](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#options) to be defined,
that will be passed to _all_ executions.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
node:
  binExecArgs:
    - '--loader'
    - '@boost/module/loader'
```
