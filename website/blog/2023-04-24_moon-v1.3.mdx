## Plugin support for proto

Earlier this week we announced [plugin support for proto](./proto-v0.7), starting with a TOML based
plugin. This is great as it allows _any_ kind of versioned tool to be managed in proto's toolchain,
so why not moon? Starting with this release, you can now install and manage moon _from_ proto, using
our officially maintained TOML plugin.

In your `.prototools` or `~/.proto/config.toml` file, add the following snippet:

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
moon = "schema:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonrepo/moon/master/proto-schema.toml"
```

And as easy as that, you can now use `moon` as a tool within any `proto` command. For example:

```shell
$ proto install moon 1.3.0
$ proto list-remote moon
$ proto bin moon
```

Furthermore, with proto, we can now pin the version of moon on a per-project basis. Perfect for
enforcing the same version for all developers on your team!

```toml title=".prototools"
moon = "1.3.0"
```

> When using this approach, be sure `~/proto/.bin` is in your `PATH`, and takes precedence over
> `~/.moon/bin`.
