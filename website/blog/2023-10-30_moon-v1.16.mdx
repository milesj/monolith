In this release, we've taken the next step in modernizing our action pipeline, by rewriting the
dependency graph.

## Bun as a package manager

Now that [Bun v1 has officially released](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0) and our
[bun-plugin](https://github.com/moonrepo/bun-plugin) for proto has stabilized, we can start slowly
integrating Bun support into moon. The first step in this series is adding Bun as a supported
package manager for Node.js. Seems odd as they are conflicting runtimes... right? While true, a lot
of users are interested in using Bun purely as a package manager, as it can install dependencies
incredibly fast. So why not support it?

In this release, you can now install dependencies with Bun:

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
  packageManager: 'bun'
  bun:
    version: '1.0.0'
```

When using Bun, the following integrations are applied:

- Will automatically download and install Bun for the configured version.
- Will install dependencies using `bun install` (deduping currently not supported).
- Will parse `bun.lockb` for dependency resolution and task hashing.
- Will use `bunx` instead of `npx` for one-off package executions.

> This change _only_ adds support for Bun as a package manager for Node.js. It does not add Bun as a
> supported language/platform in the toolchain, but it does pave the way for this to happen!
