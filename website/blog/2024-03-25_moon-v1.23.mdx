## Template & generator improvements

## Stack-based task inheritance

Last month in [moon v1.22](./moon-v1.22), we introduced the [`stack`](/docs/config/project#stack)
setting for organizing projects into what tech stack they belong to. This is primarily for
organizational purposes, and improving our project constaints implementation.

Based on community feeedback, we've expanded the `stack` setting to also apply for
[task inheritance](http://localhost:3000/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#scope-by-project-metadata).
You can now inherit tasks for the stack itself, or through a combination of the project language,
platform, and type. For example:

- `.moon/tasks/backend.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/javascript-backend.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/frontend-library.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/bun-frontend-application.yml`

## Internal tasks

We're introducing a new [task mode](/docs/concepts/task#modes) called internal, which can be enabled
with the [`internal`](/docs/config/project#internal) task option. Internal tasks are tasks that are
not meant to be ran explicitly by the user (via [`moon check`](/docs/commands/check) or
[`moon run`](/docs/commands/run)), but are used internally as dependencies of other tasks.

This functionality provides another way to organize your tasks.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  prepare:
    command: 'intermediate-step'
    options:
      internal: true
```
