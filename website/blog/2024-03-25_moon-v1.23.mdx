## Internal tasks

We're introducing a new [task mode](/docs/concepts/task#modes) called internal, which can be enabled
with the `internal` task option. Internal tasks are tasks that are not meant to be ran explicitly by
the user (via [`moon check`](/docs/commands/check) or [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run)), but are
used internally as dependencies of other tasks.

This functionality provides another way to organize your tasks.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  prepare:
    command: 'intermediate-step'
    options:
      internal: true
```

- Added an `installArgs` setting for bun/npm/pnpm/yarn in `.moon/toolchain.yml`, to customize the
  args used when installing dependencies.
