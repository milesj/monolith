## General

### Where did the name "moon" come from?

The first incarnation of the name was a misspelling of monorepo (= moonrepo). This is where the
domain moonrepo.dev came from, and our official company, moonrepo, Inc.

However, moonrepo is quite a long name with many syllables, and as someone who prefers short 1
syllable words, moon was perfect. The word moon also has great symmetry, as you can see in our logo!

But that's not all... moon is also an acronym. It originally stood for **m**onorepo,
**o**rganization, **o**rchestration, and **n**otification tool. But since moon can also be used for
polyrepos, we replaced monorepo with **m**anagement (as shown on the homepage). This is a great
acronym, as it embraces what moon is trying to solve:

- **M**anage repos, projects, and tasks with ease.
- **O**rganize projects and the repo to scale.
- **O**rchestrate tasks as efficiently as possible.
- **N**otify developers and systems about important events.

### Will moon support other languages?

Yes! Although we're focusing right now on the web ecosystem (Node.js, Rust, Go, PHP, Python, etc),
we've designed moon to be language agnostic and easily pluggable in the future. View our
[supported languages for more information](/docs#supported-languages).

### Will moon support continuous deployment?

Yes! We plan to integrate CD with the current build and CI system, but we are focusing on the latter
2 for the time being. Why not start using moon today so that you can easily adopt CD when it's
ready?

### What should be considered the "source of truth"?

If you're a frontend developer, you'll assume that a `package.json` is the source of truth for a
project, as it defines scripts, dependencies, and repo-local relations. While true, this breaks down
with additional tooling, like TypeScript project references, as now you must maintain
`tsconfig.json` as well as `package.json`. The risk of these falling out of sync is high.

This problem is further exacerbated by more tooling, or additional programming languages. What if
your frontend project is dependent on a backend project? This isn't easily modeled in
`package.json`. What if the backend project needs to be built and ran before running the frontend
project? Again, while not impossible, it's quite cumbersome to model in `package.json` scripts. So
on and so forth.

moon aims to solve this with a different approach, by standardizing all projects in the workspace on
[`moon.yml`](./config/project). With this, the `moon.yml` is the source of truth for each project,
and provides us with the following:

- The configuration is language agnostic. All projects are configured in a similar manner.
- Tasks can reference other tasks easily. For example, npm scripts referencing rake tasks, and vice
  verse, is a non-ideal experience.
- Dependencies defined with [`dependsOn`](./config/project#dependson) use moon project names, and
  not language specific semantics. This field also easily populates the dependency/project graphs.
- For JavaScript projects:
  - `package.json` dependencies (via `dependsOn`) are kept in sync when
    [`node.syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies`](./config/toolchain#syncprojectworkspacedependencies)
    is enabled.
  - `tsconfig.json` project references (via `dependsOn`) are kept in sync when
    [`typescript.syncProjectReferences`](./config/toolchain#syncprojectreferences) is enabled.

By using moon as the source of truth, we can ensure a healthy repository, by accurately keeping
everything in sync, and modifying project/language configuration to operate effectively.

:::info

With all that being said, moon supports
[implicit dependency scanning](./concepts/project#dependencies), if you'd prefer to continue
utilizing language specific functionality, instead of migrating entirely to moon.

### How to stop moon formatting JSON and YAML files?

To ensure a healthy repository state, moon constantly modifies JSON and YAML files, specifically
`package.json` and `tsconfig.json`. This may result in a different formatting style in regards to
indentation. While there is no way to stop or turn off this functionality, we respect
[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) during this process.

Create a root `.editorconfig` file to enforce a consistent syntax.

```ini title=".editorconfig"
[*.{json,yaml,yml}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

## Projects & tasks

### How to pipe or redirect tasks?

Piping (`|`) or redirecting (`>`) the output of a task (maybe to another task), whether via stdin or
through `inputs`, is currently not possible. However, you _could_ execute a custom bash script that
handles this for you, for example:

```bash title="scripts/pipe.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
moon project foo --json | jq ...
```

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
	pipe:
		command: 'bash ./scripts/pipe.sh'
		platform: 'system'
```

:::caution

Be careful when using this approach, as it may not be portable across operating systems, nor will it
utilize the toolchain. For example, if your Bash script uses `node`, this will be the binary found
on your machine, and _not_ the one in moon's toolchain. [proto](/proto) helps to solve this, but
it's not a perfect solution.

### How to run multiple commands within a task?

Only system tasks can run multiple commands via `&&` or `;` syntax. This is possible as we execute
these commands within a shell, and not directly with the toolchain.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
	multiple:
		command: 'mkdir test && cd test'
		platform: 'system'
```

Non system-tasks cannot run multiple commands, as a task in moon is a represented as a single
command, with inputs, outputs, and more, and is managed by the toolchain. However, we do suggest the
following alternatives:

- Create a task for each command, and link them as dependencies with
  [`deps`](./config/project#deps). This allows for each command to be incrementally cached (when
  enabled).
- Create a task for each command, and run them concurrently with [`moon run`](./commands/run).
- Wrap all commands in an external file, and execute that file instead. Refer to the
  [piping question](#how-to-pipe-or-redirect-tasks) above for an example.

### How to run tasks in a shell?

By default, all non-system tasks _will not_ run in a shell, as we interact with and execute a tool's
binary directly within the toolchain. We also provide no built-in support for wrapping language
based tasks within a shell, and have no plans to support this as it makes tasks less deterministic.

However, system based tasks do support shells, and will run in a shell based on the task's
[`shell`](./config/project#shell) option, as demonstrated below:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  # Runs in a shell
  global:
    command: 'some-command-on-path'
    platform: 'system'

  # Custom shells
  unix:
    command: 'bash -c some-command'
    platform: 'system'
    options:
      shell: false
  windows:
    command: 'pwsh.exe -c some-command'
    platform: 'system'
    options:
      shell: false
```

### Can we run other languages?

Yes! Although our toolchain only supports a few languages at this time, you can still run other
languages within tasks by setting their [`platform`](./config/project#platform-1) to "system".
System tasks are an escape hatch that will use any command available on the current machine.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  # Ruby
  lint:
    command: 'rubocop'
    platform: 'system'
  # PHP
  test:
    command: 'phpunit tests'
    platform: 'system'
```

However, because these languages are not supported directly within our toolchain, they will not
receive the benefits of the toolchain. Some of which are:

- Automatic installation of the language. System tasks expect the command to already exist in the
  environment, which requires the user to manually install them.
- Consistent language and dependency manager versions across all machines.
- Built-in cpu and heap profiling (language specific).
- Automatic dependency installs when the lockfile changes.
- And many more.

## JavaScript ecosystem

### Can we use `package.json` scripts?

We encourage everyone to define tasks in a [`moon.yml`](./config/project#tasks) file, as it allows
for additional metadata like `inputs`, `outputs`, `options`, and more. However, if you'd like to
keep using `package.json` scripts, enable the
[`node.inferTasksFromScripts`](./config/toolchain#infertasksfromscripts) setting.

View the [official documentation](./migrate-to-moon) for more information on this approach,
including risks, disadvantages, and caveats.

### Can moon version/publish packages?

At this time, no, as we're focusing on the build and test aspect of development. With that being
said, this is something we'd like to support first-class in the future, but until then, we suggest
the following popular tools:

- [Yarn releases](https://yarnpkg.com/features/release-workflow) (requires >= v2)
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
- [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

## Troubleshooting

### How to resolve the "version 'GLIBC_X.XX' not found" error?

This is typically caused by running moon in an old environment, like Ubuntu 18, and the minimum
required libc doesn't exist or is too old. Since moon is Rust based, we're unable to support all
environments and versions perpetually, and will only support relatively modern environments.

There's not an easy fix to this problem, but there are a few potential solutions, from easiest to
hardest:

- Run moon in a Docker container/image that has the correct environment and libs. For example, the
  `node:latest` image.
- Upgrade the enviroment to a newer one. For example, Ubuntu 18 -> 22.
- Try and install a newer libc
  ([more information](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72513993/how-install-glibc-2-29-or-higher-in-ubuntu-18-04)).
