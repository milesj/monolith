The primary focus of moon is a build system, and for it to operate in any capacity, it requires
tasks to run. In moon, a task is an npm binary or system command that is ran as a child process
within the context of a project (is the current working directory). Tasks are defined per project
with [`moon.yml`](./config/project), or inherited by all projects with
[`.moon/project.yml`](./config/global-project), but can also be inferred from `package.json` scripts
([we'll talk about this later](./migrate-to-moon)).

## Configuring a task

Most -- if not all projects -- utilize the same core tasks: linting, testing, code formatting, and
type-checking. Because these are so universal, let's implement the type-checking task in
[`.moon/project.yml`](./config/global-project), which will be inherited by all projects.

> This section assumes that `typescript` is installed as a dependency in your root, and that all
> `tsconfig.json` files have been setup correctly.

Begin by adding a `typecheck` field to the [`tasks`](./config/project#tasks) setting. This task will
use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and run `tsc` under the hood, since we defined the
[`command`](./config/project#command) setting.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml" {2,3}
tasks:
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'
```

By itself, this isn't doing much. So let's add some arguments with the
[`args`](./config/project#args) setting. We encourage everyone to use
[TypeScript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html)
for project boundaries and strict encapsulation, and as such, we'll use it below.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml" {4}
tasks:
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc --build --verbose'
```

With this, the task can be ran from the command line with
[`moon run <project>:typecheck`](./commands/run)! This is tasks in its most simplest form, but
continue reading on how to take full advantage of our build system.

### Inputs

Our task above works, but isn't very efficient as it _always_ runs, regardless of what has changed
since the last time it has ran. This becomes problematic in continuous integration environments, not
just locally.

To mitigate this problem, moon provides a system known as inputs, which are file paths, globs, and
environment variables that are used by the task when it's ran. moon will use and compare these
inputs to calculate whether to run, or to return the previous run state from the cache.

If you're a bit confused, let's demonstrate this by expanding the task with the
[`inputs`](./config/project#inputs) setting. Since this is TypeScript, we expect a `tsconfig.json`
to exist in the project, and probably in the workspace root too.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml" {5-11}
tasks:
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc --build --verbose'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
			- 'tests/**/*'
			- 'types/**/*'
			- 'tsconfig.json'
			- '/tsconfig.*.json'
			- '/tsconfig.json'
```

This list of inputs may look complicated, but they are merely run checks. For example, when moon
detects a change in...

- Any files within the `src`, `tests`, and `types` folders, relative from the project's root.
- A `tsconfig.json` in the project's root.
- A `tsconfig.json` or any `tsconfig.*.json` in the workspace root (denoted by the leading `/`).

...the task will be ran! If the change occurs _outside_ of the project or _outside_ the list of
inputs, the task will _not_ be ran.

Inputs are a powerful feature that can be fine-tuned to your project's need. Be as granular or open
as you want, the choice is yours!

### Outputs

Outputs are the opposite of [inputs](#inputs), as they are files and folders that are created as a
result of running the task. With that being said, outputs are _optional_, as not all tasks require
them, and the ones that do are typically build related.

Now why is declaring outputs important? For incremental builds and smart caching! When moon
encounters a build that has already been built, it hydrates all necessary outputs from the cache,
then immediately exits. No more waiting for long builds!

Continuing our example, since we're using TypeScript project references and it generates declaration
files, we'll write them to a project local `dts` folder and mark it as an output. Let's expand our
task with the [`outputs`](./config/project#outputs) setting.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml" {12,13}
tasks:
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc --build --verbose'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
			- 'tests/**/*'
			- 'types/**/*'
			- 'tsconfig.json'
			- '/tsconfig.*.json'
			- '/tsconfig.json'
		outputs:
			- 'dts'
```

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "outDir": "dts"
  }
}
```

## Depending on other tasks

While not relating to our TypeScript example above, but is important to talk about, is the concept
of task dependencies. For scenarios where you need run a task _before_ another task, as you're
expecting some repository state or artifact to exist, can be achieved with the
[`deps`](./config/project#deps) setting, which requires a list of [targets](./concepts/target):

- `<project>:<task>` - Full canonical target.
- `~:<task>` - A task within the current project.
- `^:<task>` - A task from all depended on projects (via [`dependsOn`](./config/project#dependson)).

```yaml
dependsOn:
	# ...

tasks:
	build:
		# ...
		deps:
			- '^:build'
```

## Using file groups

Once you're familiar with configuring tasks, you may notice certain inputs being repeated
constantly, like source files, test files, and configuration. To reduce the amount of boilerplate
required, moon provides a feature known as [file groups](./concepts/file-group), which enables
grouping of similar file types within a project using
[file glob patterns or literal file paths](./concepts/file-pattern).

File groups are defined with the [`fileGroups`](./config/project#filegroups) setting, which maps a
list of file paths/globs to a group, like so.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
fileGroups:
	configs:
		- '*.config.js'
		- 'tsconfig.json'
		- '/tsconfig.*.json'
		- '/tsconfig.json'
	sources:
		- 'src/**/*'
		- 'types/**/*'
	tests:
		- 'tests/**/*'
```

We can then replace the inputs in our task above with these new file groups using a syntax known as
[tokens](./concepts/token), specifically the [`@globs`](./concepts/token#globs) and
[`@files`](./concepts/token#files) token functions. Tokens are an advanced feature, so please refer
to their documentation for more information!

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml" {6-8}
tasks:
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc --build --verbose'
		inputs:
			- '@globs(sources)'
			- '@globs(tests)'
			- '@files(configs)'
		outputs:
			- 'dts'
```

With file groups (and tokens), you're able to reduce the amount of configuration required _and_
encourage certain file structures for consuming projects!
