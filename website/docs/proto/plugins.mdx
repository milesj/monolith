title: Plugins
---

proto supports a pluggable architecture as a means for consumers to integrate and manage custom
tools (languages, CLIs, etc) within proto's toolchain. It's not possible for proto to support
_everything_ in core directly, so plugins are a way for the community to extend the toolchain to
their needs.

## Enabling plugins

Plugins can be enabled by configuring them in
[`.prototools` or `~/.proto/.prototools`](./config#plugins) files, within the `[plugins]` section.
The map key is the plugin name _in kebab-case_, which is used as the binary/tool name in proto, and
also the name for configuration and cache purposes. The map value is a
[plugin locator string](../guides/wasm-plugins#configuring-plugin-locations) that defines a scope
and source location.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
<id> = "<scope>:<location>"
```

## Creating plugins

To ease the plugin development process, proto supports 2 types of plugins, a
[TOML based plugin](./toml-plugin) for basic use cases, and a [WASM based plugin](./wasm-plugin) for
advanced use cases.
