proto supports a pluggable architecture as a means for consumers to integrate and manage custom
tools (languages, CLIs, etc) within proto's toolchain. It's not possible for proto to support
_everything_ in core directly, so plugins are a way for the community to extend the toolchain to
their needs.

## Enabling plugins

Plugins can be enabled by configuring them in
[`.prototools` or `~/.proto/config.toml`](./config#plugins) files.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
my-tool = "source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my/tool/master/proto-plugin.wasm"
```

## Creating plugins

To ease the plugin development process, proto supports 2 types of plugins, a
[TOML based plugin](./toml-plugin) for basic use cases, and a [WASM based plugin](./wasm-plugin) for
advanced use cases.
