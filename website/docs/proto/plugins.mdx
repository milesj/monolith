title: Plugins
---

proto supports a pluggable architecture as a means for consumers to integrate and manage custom
tools (languages, CLIs, etc) within proto's toolchain. It's not possible for proto to support
_everything_ in core directly, so plugins are a way for the community to extend the toolchain with
custom tools.

To ease the plugin development process, proto supports 2 types of plugins, a TOML schema based
plugin, and a WASM based plugin (coming soon!).

## TOML schema plugin

The TOML schema plugin is by design, very simple. It's a TOML file that describes the tool, how it
should be installed, and how it should be invoked. Since this is a static configuration file, it
does not support any logic or dynamic behavior, and is merely for simple and common use cases.

Let's start by creating a new schema plugin, and defining the `name` and `type` fields. The type can
either be `language`, `dependency-manager`, or `cli`. For this example, we'll create a plugin for
our fake product called Protostar, a CLI tool.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
name = "Protostar"
type = "cli"
```

### Platform variations

Native tools are often platform specific, and proto supports this by allowing you to define
variations based on operating system using the `[platform]` section. For non-native tools, this
section can typically be skipped.

This section requires a mapping of Rust
[`OS` strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.OS.html) to platform settings. The
following settings are available:

- `archive-prefix` - If the tool is distributed as an archive (zip, tar, etc), this is the name of
  the direct folder within the archive that contains the tool, and will be removed when unpacking
  the archive. If there is no prefix folder within the archive, this setting can be omitted.
- `bin-path` - The path to the executable binary within the archive (without the prefix). If the
  tool is distributed as a single binary, this setting can be typically omitted.
- `checksum-file` - Name of the checksum file to verify the downloaded file with. If the tool does
  not support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.
- `download-file` (required) - Name of the file to download.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[platform.linux]
archive-prefix = "protostar-linux"
bin-path = "bins/protostar"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-unknown-linux-{libc}.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-unknown-linux-{libc}.tar.gz"

[platform.macos]
archive-prefix = "protostar-macos"
bin-path = "bins/protostar"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-apple-darwin.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-apple-darwin.tar.xz"

[platform.windows]
archive-prefix = "protostar-windows"
bin-path = "bins/protostar.exe"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-pc-windows-msvc.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
```

You may have noticed tokens above, like `{arch}`. These are special tokens that are replaced with a
dynamic value at runtime, based on the current host machine executing the code. The following tokens
are available:

- `{version}` - The currently resolved version, as a fully-qualifed semantic version:
  `major.minor.patch`.
- `{arch}` - The architecture of the host machine, like `x86_64`. These values map to Rust's
  [`ARCH` constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.ARCH.html), but can be
  customized with [`install.arch`](#downloading-and-installing).
- `{libc}` - For Linux machines, this is the current libc implementation, either `gnu` or `musl`.

### Downloading and installing

A schema plugin _only_ supports downloading pre-built tools, typically as an archive, and does _not_
support building from source. The `[install]` section can be used to configure how the tool should
be downloaded and installed into the toolchain. The following settings are available:

- `arch` - A mapping of Rust
  [`ARCH` strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.ARCH.html) to custom values for
  the `{arch}` token. This is useful if the tool has different terminology.
- `checksum-url` - A secure URL to download the checksum file for verification. If the tool does not
  support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.
- `download-url` (required) - A secure URL to download the tool/archive.

The URL settings support `{checksum_file}` and `{download_file}` tokens, which will be replaced with
the values from the `[platform]` section.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[install]
checksum-url = "https://github.com/moonrepo/protostar/releases/download/v{version}/{checksum_file}"
download-url = "https://github.com/moonrepo/protostar/releases/download/v{version}/{download_file}"

[install.arch]
aarch64 = "arm64"
x86_64 = "x64"
```

The `[install]` sections also supports the following settings that dictate the installation of
global binaries for the tool. If the tool does not support globals (is not a programming language),
these settings can be omitted.

- `globals-dir` - A list of directories to locate and install the global binaries into. This setting
  supports interpolating environment variables via the syntax `$ENV_VAR`.
- `global-args` - A list of CLI arguments to pass to the tool to install a global binary. The name
  of the binary can be inserted using the `{dependency}` token.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[install]
globals-dir = ["$PROTOSTAR_HOME/bin", "$HOME/.protostar/bin"]
global-args = ["install", "--force", "{dependency}"]
```
