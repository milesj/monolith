title: Plugins
---

proto supports a pluggable architecture as a means for consumers to integrate and manage custom
tools (languages, CLIs, etc) within proto's toolchain. It's not possible for proto to support
_everything_ in core directly, so plugins are a way for the community to extend the toolchain to
their needs.

## Enabling plugins

Plugins can be enabled by configuring them in
[`.prototools` or `~/.proto/config.toml`](./config#plugins) files, within the `[plugins]` section.
The map key is the plugin name _in kebab-case_, which is used as the binary/tool name in proto, and
also the name for configuration and cache purposes. The map value is a plugin locator string that
defines a scope and source location.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
<id> = "<scope>:<location>"
```

The following locator patterns are supported:

### `source:`

The `source:` locator scope supports both secure URLs and file system paths (relative from the
config file). Files will be used as-is, while URLs will be downloaded to `~/.proto/plugins`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
file-tool = "source:plugins/example.wasm"
url-tool = "source:https://domain.com/path/to/plugins/example.wasm"
```

### `github:`

The `github:` locator scope can be used to target and download an asset from a specific GitHub
release. The location must be an organization + repository slug (owner/repo), and the release _must
have_ a `.wasm` asset available to download.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
github-tool = "github:moonrepo/example-repo"
```

By default, the latest release will be used and cached for 7 days. If you'd prefer to target a
specific release, append the release tag to the end of the location.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
github-tool = "github:moonrepo/example-repo@v1.2.3"
```

This strategy is powered by the [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/) and is subject to rate
limiting. If running in a CI environment, we suggesting setting a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable to authorize API requests with. If using GitHub Actions, it's as simple as:

```yaml
# In some job or step...
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
```

## Creating plugins

To ease the plugin development process, proto supports 2 types of plugins, a
[TOML based plugin](./toml-plugin) for basic use cases, and a [WASM based plugin](./wasm-plugin) for
advanced use cases.
