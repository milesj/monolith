The `proto completions` command will generate proto command and argument completions for your
current shell. This command will write to stdout, which can then be redirected to a file of your
choice.

```shell
$ proto completions > ~/.bash_completion.d/proto.sh
```

### Options

- `--shell` - Shell to explicitly generate for. Accepts "bash", "elvish", "fish", "powershell", or
  "zsh".
