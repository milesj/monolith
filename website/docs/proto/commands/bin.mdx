The `proto bin <tool>` command will return an absolute path to a tool's binary within the toolchain.
When a tool has not been installed, or a version cannot be resolved, the command will exit with a
failure.

```shell
$ proto bin node 16.10.0
/Users/example/.proto/tools/node/16.10.0/bin/node
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. If not provided, will attempt to
  [detect the version](../detection).

### Options

- `--shim` - When applicable, return an absolute path to a tool's local shim file.
