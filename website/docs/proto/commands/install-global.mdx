title: install-global
---

The `proto install-global <tool> ...<dependencies>` (or `proto ig`) command will install one or many
global packages/modules/dependencies for the provided tool.

Where globals are installed and linked are dependent on the tool. For example, Deno installs to
`~/.deno/bin` and Rust to `~/.cargo/bin`. Refer to the [supported tools](../tools) section for all
install locations, and the
[FAQ for more information](../faq#how-can-i-install-a-global-binary-for-a-language) on why this
exists.

```shell
# Install a global by name
$ proto install-global rust cargo-release

# Install multiple globals
$ proto install-global rust cargo-release cargo-udeps

# Can also include an optional version (depending on the language)
$ proto install-global node typescript@v5
```

:::caution

proto installs globals but _does not_ make them available on `PATH`. You'll need to manually add all
the [global binary locations](../tools) to `PATH` from your shell profile.

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
