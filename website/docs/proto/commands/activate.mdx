The `proto activate <shell>` command will activate proto for the current shell session, by exporting
environment variables and prepending `PATH` for each tool configured in the current directory.
Activation is ran each time the current directory changes using a shell hook.

[shell activation in the official workflow documentation](../workflows#shell-activation)!

### Setup

The following activation steps should be added _after_ all environment variable and `PATH`
modifications have happened in your shell, typically at the end of your shell profile.

#### Bash

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.

```shell
eval "$(proto activate bash)"
```

#### Elvish

Generate the hook:

```shell
proto activate elvish > ~/.elvish/lib/proto-hook.elv
```

Then add the following line to your `~/.elvish/rc.elv` file.

```shell
use proto-hook
```

#### Fish

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

```shell
proto activate fish | source
```

#### Murex

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.murex_profile`.

```shell
proto activate murex -> source
```

#### Nu

Generate the hook:

```shell
proto activate nu > ~/.config/nushell/proto-hook.nu
```

Then add the following line to your `~/.config/nushell/config.nu` file.

```shell
use proto-hook.nu
```

#### Pwsh

Add the following line to the end of your profile (`$PROFILE`).

```shell
Invoke-Expression "$(proto activate pwsh)"
```

#### Zsh

Add the following line to the end of your `~/.zshrc`.

```shell
eval "$(proto activate zsh)"
```

### Options

- `--export` - Print the activate instructions in shell-specific syntax.
- `--json` - Print the activate instructions in JSON format.
