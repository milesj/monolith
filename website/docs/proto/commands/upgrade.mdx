The `proto upgrade` (or `proto up`) command can be used to upgrade your current proto binary to the
latest version.

```shell
$ proto upgrade
```

:::info

The previous binary will be moved to `~/.proto/tools/proto/<version>`, while the new binary will be
installed to `~/.proto/bin`. The install location can be customized with the `PROTO_INSTALL_DIR`
environment variable.
