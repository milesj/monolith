title: run
---

The `proto run <tool>` command will run a tool after detecting a version from the environment. In
order of priority, a version will be resolved from:

- Explicitly passed as a CLI argument
- A `PROTO_<TOOL>_VERSION` environment variable
- A local version file (`.prototools`)
- From the tool's ecosystem (for example, `package.json` in Node.js)
- A global version file (`~/.proto/tools/<tool>/version`)

```shell
# Run and detect version from environment
$ proto run bun

# Run with explicit version
$ proto run bun 0.5.3

# Run with version from environment variable
$ PROTO_BUN_VERSION=0.5.3 proto run bun
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. If not provided, will attempt to detect the version from the
  environment.
