Is your `~/.proto` installation growing out of control? Well, the `proto clean` command can be used
to uninstall all stale and unused tools. By default, it will remove tools that haven't been used in
the last 30 days.

```shell
$ proto clean
```

### Options

- `--days` - Number of days before a tool is considered stale.
