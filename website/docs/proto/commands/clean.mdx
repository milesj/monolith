The `proto clean` command can be used to uninstall stale and unused tools or plugins. By default, it
will remove items that haven't been used in the last 30 days.

```shell
$ proto clean
```

Furthermore, the command can be used to purge a tool, which will remove it entirely from proto, or
purge all downloaded plugins.

```shell
# Delete node from proto
$ proto clean --purge node

# Delete all plugins
$ proto clean --purge-plugins
```

### Options

- `--days` - Number of days before a tool is considered stale.
- `--purge` - Purge and delete the installed tool by ID (`~/.proto/tools/<id>`).
- `--purge-plugins` - Purge and delete all downloaded plugins (`~/.proto/plugins`).
- `--yes` - Avoid and confirm all prompts.
