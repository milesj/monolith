title: setup
---

The `proto setup` command will setup proto in your current shell by modifying an applicable profile
file and appending proto's bin directory to `PATH`.

```shell
$ proto setup
```

During setup, the following profiles will be searched or prompted for. To override these, pass the
`PROTO_SHELL_PROFILE` environment variable.

- All shells
  - `~/.profile`
  - `PROFILE` environment variable
- Bash
  - `~/.bash_profile`
  - `~/.bashrc`
- Elvish
  - `~/.elvish/rc.elv`
  - `~/.config/elvish/rc.elv`
- Fish
  - `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- PowerShell
  - Windows
    - `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
    - `~\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1`
  - Unix
    - `~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
    - `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
- Zsh
  - `~/.zprofile`
  - `~/.zshenv`
  - `~/.zshrc`

### Windows support

In addition to updating a shell profile file (most likely PowerShell), we'll also modify the `PATH`
(or `Path`) system environment variable, by prepending the `~/.proto/shims` and `~/.proto/bin`
paths.

If you would like to opt-out of this behavior, pass the `--no-modify-path` flag.

### Options

- `--shell` - Shell to explicitly setup for.
- `--no-modify-profile` - Don't update a shell profile file.
- `--no-modify-path` - Don't update the system `PATH` environment variable (Windows only).
- `--yes` - Avoid interactive prompts and use defaults.
