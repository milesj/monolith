The `proto local <tool> <version>` command will set the local version of a tool by creating a
`.prototools` file (if it does not exist) in the current working directory with the appropriate tool
and version. This version will be used when attempting to detect a version in [`proto bin`](./bin)
and [`proto run`](./run).

```shell
$ proto local go 1.20.1
```
