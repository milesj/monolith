title: install
---

The `proto install <tool> [version]` (or `proto i`) command will download and install a tool by
unpacking their archive to `~/.proto/tools/<tool>`. If the tool has already been installed, the
command will exit early.

The command is also smart enough to resolve partial versions, so 1, 1.2, and 1.2.3 are all
acceptable. It even supports aliases when applicable, like `latest`, `next`, `beta`, etc. To install
a canary release, use `--canary`.

```shell
$ proto install deno 1.31
$ proto install deno --canary
```

### Pinning the version

By default this command will only install the tool into `~/.proto/tools`. If you would like to also
pin the resolved version to a `.prototools` file, use the `--pin` option.

```shell
# ~/.prototools
$ proto install bun --pin
$ proto install bun --pin local

# ~/.proto/.prototools
$ proto install bun --pin global
```

### Handling plugin hooks

Some tools run [post-install hooks](../tools) that support arbitrary arguments that can be passed
after `--`.

```shell
$ proto install go -- --no-gobin
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. Defaults to "latest".
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to pass to post-install hooks.

### Options

- `--canary` - Install a canary (next, nightly, etc) version.
- `--pin` - Pin the resolved version and create a symlink in `~/.proto/bin`. Accepts a boolean (pins
  locally by default), or the string "global", or the string "local".
