title: install
---

The `proto install <tool>` (or `proto i`) command will download and install a tool by unpacking
their archive to `~/.proto/tools/<tool>`. If the tool has already been installed, the command will
exit early.

The command is also smart enough to resolve partial versions, so 1, 1.2, and 1.2.3 are all
acceptable. It even supports aliases when applicable, like `latest`, `next`, `beta`, etc. To install
a canary release, use `--canary`.

```shell
$ proto install deno 1.31
$ proto install deno --canary
```

Some tools run [post-install hooks](../tools) that support arbitrary arguments that can be passed
after `--`.

```shell
$ proto install go -- --no-gobin
```

### Arguments

- `<tool>` - Type of tool.
- `[version]` - Version of tool. Defaults to "latest".
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to pass to post-install hooks.

### Options

- `--canary` - Install a canary (next, nightly, etc) version.
- `--pin` - Pin the resolved version and create a symlink in `~/.proto/bin`. Accepts a boolean (pins
  globally), or the string "global", or the string "local".
