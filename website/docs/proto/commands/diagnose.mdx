The `proto diagnose` command will diagnose your proto installation for any potential issues. Issues
are categorized into errors and warnings, with the former being a must fix, and the latter being a
maybe fix (depending on your usage of proto).

```
$ proto diagnose

Shell: zsh
Shell profile: ~/.zshrc

Errors
  Issue: Bin directory (~/.proto/bin) was found BEFORE the shims directory (~/.proto/shims) on PATH
  Resolution: Ensure the shims path comes before the bin path in your shell

Warnings
  Issue: Missing PROTO_HOME environment variable (Will default to ~/.proto if not defined)
  Resolution: Export PROTO_HOME="$HOME/.proto" from your shell
```

### Options

- `--shell` - The shell to diagnose (will detect automatically).
- `--json` - Print the diagnosis in JSON format.
