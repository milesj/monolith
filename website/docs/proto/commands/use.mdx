title: use
---

The `proto use` (or `proto u`) command will download and install _all_ tools and plugins from all
parent [`.prototools`](../config) configuration files, and any [versions detected](../detection) in
the current working directory (if not defined in `.prototools`).

If [`auto-clean`](../config#user-configuration) is enabled, the command will also remove any stale
or unused tools.

```shell
$ proto use
```
