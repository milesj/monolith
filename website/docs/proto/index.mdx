## Supported tools

A tool is either a programming language, or a dependency (package) manager for a language. The
following tools are currently supported in proto:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**
- **[Deno](https://deno.land)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
  - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
  - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- **[Go](https://go.dev)**

## Supported targets

Because proto is written in Rust, we only support targets that are explicitly compiled for, which
are currently:

| Operating system | Architecture | Target                       |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------- |
| macOS 64-bit     | Intel        | `x86_64-apple-darwin`        |
| macOS 64-bit     | ARM          | `aarch64-apple-darwin`       |
| Linux 64-bit     | Intel GNU    | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`   |
| Linux 64-bit     | Intel musl   | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`  |
| Linux 64-bit     | ARM GNU      | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`  |
| Linux 64-bit     | ARM musl     | `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Windows 64-bit   | Intel        | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`     |
