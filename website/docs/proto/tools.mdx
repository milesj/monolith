title: Supported tools
---

import WasmLink from '@site/src/components/Docs/WasmLink';

The following tools are supported natively in proto's toolchain. Additional tools can be supported
through [plugins](./plugins).

## Bun

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/bun-plugin" />

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is an all-in-one runtime and toolset for JavaScript and TypeScript, powered
by Zig and Webkit.

- **Available binaries** - `bun`, `bunx`
- **Globals directory** - `~/.bun/bin`

## Deno

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/deno-plugin" />

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, powered by Rust and
Chrome's V8 engine.

- **Available binaries** - `deno`
- **Globals directory** - `$DENO_INSTALL_ROOT/bin`, `~/.deno/bin`
- **Detection sources** - [`.dvmrc`](https://github.com/justjavac/dvm)

## Go

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/go-plugin" />

[Go](https://go.dev/) is a simple, secure, and fast systems language.

- **Available binaries** - `go`
- **Globals directory** - `$GOBIN`, `~/go/bin`
- **Detection sources** - [`go.work`](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces),
  [`go.mod`](https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref)

#### Post-install hook

After installation, we'll inject a `GOBIN` environment variable into your shell, pointing to
`~/go/bin`, if it does not already exist. This variable will be used to locate Go binaries across
all installed versions. This functionality can be skipped by passing `--no-gobin` during
installation.

```shell
$ proto install go -- --no-gobin
```

## Node.js

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin" />

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

- **Available binaries** - `node`, `npx`
- **Globals directory** - `~/.proto/tools/node/globals/bin`
- **Detection sources** - [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
  [`.node-version`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), `package.json` engines

#### Post-install hook

After installation, the version of npm that came bundled with Node.js will also be installed. This
functionality can be skipped by passing `--no-bundled-npm` during installation.

```shell
$ proto install node -- --no-bundled-npm
```

### npm, pnpm, yarn

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin" />

proto supports all popular Node.js package managers: `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`.

- **Available binaries** - `*`, `node-gyp`
- **Detection sources** - `package.json` engines / package manager

### corepack

Corepack _is not supported_ by proto, and will never be. Use [`proto use`](./commands/use) instead,
which is a far more poweful alternative.

## Python

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/python-plugin" />

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

- **Available binaries** - `python`, `pip`
- **Globals directory** - `~/.local/bin`
- **Detection sources** - [`.python-version`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

## Rust

<WasmLink to="https://github.com/moonrepo/rust-plugin" />

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (`rust`) is blazingly fast and memory-efficient systems language.

:::caution

If you're familiar with Rust, you most likely use [rustup](https://rustup.rs), a Rust specific
toolchain manager. This overlaps heavily with how proto works, so instead of proto reinventing the
wheel here, we simply call `rustup` under the hood. Because of this, be aware of the following when
using Rust in proto:

- Rust and Cargo must be pre-installed on your system.
- The `~/.cargo/bin` directory must be in your `PATH`.
- We don't install Rust to `~/.proto/tools/rust` but instead reference `~/.rustup/toolchains`.
- We don't create shims for `cargo`, `rustup`, etc.

:::

Since we don't create shims for `cargo`, `rustup`, etc, we can't detect Rust versions at runtime.
However, `rustup` supports this as well through the
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) file.
We suggest using this file.

```toml title="rust-toolchain.toml"
[toolchain]
profile = "default"
channel = "1.68.0"
```
