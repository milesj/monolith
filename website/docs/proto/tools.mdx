title: Supported tools
---

The following tools are supported in proto's toolchain.

## Bun

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) (`bun`) is an all-in-one runtime and toolset for JavaScript and TypeScript,
powered by Zig and Webkit.

## Deno

[Deno](https://deno.land/) (`deno`) is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, powered by
Rust and Chrome's V8 engine.

#### Detection sources

- A [`.dvmrc`](https://github.com/justjavac/dvm) file.

## Go

[Go](https://go.dev/) (`go`) is a simple, secure, and fast systems language.

#### Post-install hook

After installation, we'll inject a `GOBIN` environment variable into your shell, pointing to
`~/go/bin`, if it does not already exist. This variable will be used to locate Go binaries across
all installed versions. This functionality can be skipped by passing `--no-gobin` during
installation.

```shell
$ proto install go -- --no-gobin
```

#### Detection sources

- Native [`go.work`](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces) or
  [`go.mod`](https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref) files.

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`node`) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

#### Post-install hook

After installation, the version of npm that came bundled with Node.js will also be installed. This
functionality can be skipped by passing `--no-bundled-npm` during installation.

```shell
$ proto install node -- --no-bundled-npm
```

#### Detection sources

- An [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or
  [`.node-version`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) file.
- The [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) field in
  `package.json`.

:::info

When parsing engines, explicit versions (`1.2.3`, `=1.2.3`) will be used as-is, but
requirements/ranges (`^1.2.3`, `>=1.2.3`) will scan `~/.proto/tools/node` for an applicable match.

:::

### npm, pnpm, yarn

proto supports all popular Node.js package managers: `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`.

#### Detection sources

- The `packageManager` field in `package.json`.
- The [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) field in
  `package.json` (same notice above applies).
