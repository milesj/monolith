## General

### Where did the name "proto" come from?

We wanted to keep with the space theme, and spent quite some time digging through Wikipedia and
ultimately landed on the page for [protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar) (this is why
our logo's a star). We really liked the definition of protostar, as it basically means "the
beginning phase of a star". Even the the prefix proto means "first" or "earliest form of".

This was great as that's the impression we had in mind for our tool. proto is the first piece
required for setting up your developer environment. The toolchain is the first piece in the
foundation.

From an aesthetic standpoint, proto's typography works well with moon and moonbase, as most of the
letters are circle shaped. Double points for proto having two o's like the other products!

### Are you worried about confusion with other tools like protobufs?

Nah.

### Will you support more languages?

Yes! We'd love to support as many as possible.

### Will you support "build from source"?

In the future we have plans to support building from source. For the time being, proto is built
around pre-built archives for easier portability.

### Can I contribute a new language?

Yes, go for it! We have no official guide on how to do this, but the Rust code is rather straight
forward. Feel free to copy another
[language crate](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/tree/master/crates).
