## General

### Where did the name "proto" come from?

We wanted to keep with the space theme, and spent quite some time digging through Wikipedia and
ultimately landed on the page for [protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar) (this is why
our logo's a star). We really liked the definition of protostar, as it basically means "the
beginning phase of a star". Even the the prefix proto means "first" or "earliest form of".

This was great as that's the impression we had in mind for our tool. proto is the first piece
required for setting up your developer environment. The toolchain is the first layer in the
foundation.

From an aesthetic standpoint, proto's typography works well with moon and moonbase, as most of the
letters are circle shaped. Double points for proto having two o's like the other products!

### Are you worried about confusion with other tools like protobufs?

Nah.

### Will you support more languages?

Yes! We'd love to support as many as possible. We're looking into supporting Python, Ruby, and PHP
next. Feel free to create a [plugin](./plugins) in the mean time.

### Will you support other kinds of tools?

No, we will only support languages and dependency managers. However, you can create a
[plugin](./plugins) to support other kinds of tools.

### Will you support "build from source"?

In the future we have plans to support building from source. For the time being, proto is built
around pre-built archives for easier portability.

### Can I contribute a new language?

Yes, go for it! We have no official guide on how to do this, but the Rust code is rather straight
forward. Feel free to copy another
[language crate](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/tree/master/crates).

### How can I install a global binary for a language?

You can install a global with the [`proto install-global`](./commands/install-global) command. Most
languages install a global to a shared location regardless of the language's version (Deno is
`~/.deno/bin`, Rust is `~/.cargo/bin`, etc), so globals can also be installed _outside_ of proto
using language specific commands.

The exception to this is Node.js (and npm, pnpm, yarn). Each of these tools install global packages
_differently_, and they're also tied to the parent tools version. So if you install a new language
version, you lose your global packages. We suggest using `proto install-global` for all Node.js
packages, which installs everything to a shared location, `~/.proto/tools/node/globals/bin`.

You'll also need to manually add these global directories to your `PATH`.
