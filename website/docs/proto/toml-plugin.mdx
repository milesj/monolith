The TOML plugin is by design, very simple. It's a TOML file that describes a schema for the tool,
how it should be installed, and how it should be invoked. Since this is a static configuration file,
it does not support any logic or complex behavior, and is merely for simple and common use cases,
like CLIs.

## Create a plugin

Let's start by creating a new plugin, and defining the `name` and `type` fields. The type can either
be `language`, `dependency-manager`, or `cli`. For this example, we'll create a plugin for our fake
product called Protostar, a CLI tool.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
name = "Protostar"
type = "cli"
```

### Platform variations

Native tools are often platform specific, and proto supports this by allowing you to define
variations based on operating system using the `[platform]` section. For non-native tools, this
section can typically be skipped.

This section requires a mapping of Rust
[`OS` strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.OS.html) to platform settings. The
following settings are available:

- `archive-prefix` - If the tool is distributed as an archive (zip, tar, etc), this is the name of
  the direct folder within the archive that contains the tool, and will be removed when unpacking
  the archive. If there is no prefix folder within the archive, this setting can be omitted.
- `bin-path` - The path to the executable binary within the archive (without the prefix). If the
  tool is distributed as a single binary, this setting can be typically omitted.
- `checksum-file` - Name of the checksum file to verify the downloaded file with. If the tool does
  not support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.
- `download-file` (required) - Name of the file to download.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[platform.linux]
archive-prefix = "protostar-linux"
bin-path = "bins/protostar"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-unknown-linux-{libc}.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-unknown-linux-{libc}.tar.gz"

[platform.macos]
archive-prefix = "protostar-macos"
bin-path = "bins/protostar"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-apple-darwin.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-apple-darwin.tar.xz"

[platform.windows]
archive-prefix = "protostar-windows"
bin-path = "bins/protostar.exe"
checksum-file = "protostar-{arch}-pc-windows-msvc.sha256"
download-file = "protostar-{arch}-pc-windows-msvc.zip"
```

You may have noticed tokens above, like `{arch}`. These are special tokens that are replaced with a
dynamic value at runtime, based on the current host machine executing the code. The following tokens
are available:

- `{version}` - The currently resolved version, as a fully-qualifed semantic version:
  `major.minor.patch`.
- `{arch}` - The architecture of the host machine, like `x86_64`. These values map to Rust's
  [`ARCH` constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.ARCH.html), but can be
  customized with [`install.arch`](#downloading-and-installing).
- `{libc}` - For Linux machines, this is the current libc implementation, either `gnu` or `musl`.

### Downloading and installing

A TOML plugin _only_ supports downloading pre-built tools, typically as an archive, and does _not_
support building from source. The `[install]` section can be used to configure how the tool should
be downloaded and installed into the toolchain. The following settings are available:

- `arch` - A mapping of Rust
  [`ARCH` strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/consts/constant.ARCH.html) to custom values for
  the `{arch}` token. This is useful if the tool has different terminology.
- `checksum-url` - A secure URL to download the checksum file for verification. If the tool does not
  support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.
- `download-url` (required) - A secure URL to download the tool/archive.
- `unpack` - Whether the downloaded file should be unpacked or not. For tools that download the
  binary directly, this should be disabled.

The URL settings support `{checksum_file}` and `{download_file}` tokens, which will be replaced with
the values from the `[platform]` section.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[install]
checksum-url = "https://github.com/moonrepo/protostar/releases/download/v{version}/{checksum_file}"
download-url = "https://github.com/moonrepo/protostar/releases/download/v{version}/{download_file}"

[install.arch]
aarch64 = "arm64"
x86_64 = "x64"
```

The `[install]` sections also supports the following settings that dictate the installation of
global binaries for the tool. If the tool does not support globals (is not a programming language),
these settings can be omitted.

- `globals-dir` - A list of directories to locate and install the global binaries into. This setting
  supports interpolating environment variables via the syntax `$ENV_VAR`.
- `global-args` - A list of CLI arguments to pass to the tool to install a global binary. The name
  of the binary can be inserted using the `{dependency}` token.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[install]
globals-dir = ["$PROTOSTAR_HOME/bin", "$HOME/.protostar/bin"]
global-args = ["install", "--force", "{dependency}"]
```

### Resolving versions

Now that the tool can be downloaded and installed, we must configure how to resolve available
versions. Resolving is configured through the `[resolve]` section, which supports 2 patterns to
resolve with: Git tags or a JSON manifest.

#### Git tags

To resolve a list of available versions using Git tags, the following settings are available:

- `git-url` - The remote URL to fetch tags from.
- `git-tag-pattern` - A regular expression to filter and match with. Defaults to
  `^v?((\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+))`. The capture group `1` will be extracted as the version.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[resolve]
git-url = "https://github.com/moonrepo/protostar"
git-tag-pattern = "^@protostar/cli@((\\d+)\.(\\d+)\.(\\d+))"
```

#### JSON manifest

To resolve a list of available versions using a JSON manifest, the following settings are available:

- `manifest-url` - A URL that returns a JSON response of all versions. This response _must be_ an
  array of strings, or an array of objects.
- `manifest-version-key` - If the response is an array of objects, this is the key to extract the
  version from. If the response is an array of strings, this setting can be omitted. Defaults to
  `version`.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[resolve]
manifest-url = "https://someregistry.com/protostar/versions.json"
manifest-version-key = "latest_version"
```

### Detecting versions

And lastly, we can configure how to [detect a version](./detection) contextually at runtime, using
the `[detect]` setting. At this time, we only support 1 setting:

- `version-files` - A list of version files to extract from. The contents of these files can _only_
  be the version string itself.

```toml title="protostar.toml"
# ...

[detect]
version-files = [".protostar-version", ".protostarrc"]
```
