Plugins can be written in [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/), a portable binary format.
This means that plugins can be written in any language that compiles to WASM, like Rust, C, C++, Go,
TypeScript, and more. Because WASM based plugins are powered by a programming language, they
implicitly support complex business logic and behavior, have access to a sandboxed file system (via
WASI), can execute child processes, and much more.

:::danger

Since our WASM plugin implementation is still experimental, expect breaking changes to occur in
non-major releases.

:::

## Concepts

Before we begin, let's talk about a few concepts that are critical to WASM and our plugin system.

### Virtual paths

WASM by default does not have access to the host file system, but through [WASI](https://wasi.dev/),
we can provide sandboxed access to a pre-defined list of allowed directories. We call this
[virtual paths](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/enum.VirtualPath.html), and all paths
provided via function input or context use them.

Virtual paths are implemented by mapping a real path (host machine) to a virtual path (guest
runtime) using file path prefixes. The following prefixes are currently supported:

| Real path  | Virtual path |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `~`        | `/home`      |
| `~/.proto` | `/proto`     |
| CWD        | `/workspace` |

For example, from the context of WASM, you may have a virtual path of `/proto/tools/node/1.2.3`,
which simply maps back to `~/.proto/tools/node/1.2.3` on the host machine. However, this should
almost always be transparent to you, the developer, and to end users.

However, there may be a few cases where you need access to the real path from WASM, for example,
logging or executing commands. For this, the real path can be accessed with the
[`real_path`](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/enum.VirtualPath.html#method.real_path)
function on the `VirtualPath` enum (this is a Rust only feature).

```rust
input.tool_dir.real_path();
```

### Host environment

Since WASM executes in its own runtime, it _does not_ have access to the current host operating
system, architecture, so on and so forth. To bridge this gap, we provide the
[`get_proto_environment`](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/fn.get_proto_environment.html)
function.
[Learn more about this type](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/struct.HostEnvironment.html).

```rust
let env = get_proto_environment()?;
```

The host operating system and architecture can be accessed with `os` and `arch` fields respectively.
Both fields are an enum in Rust, or a string in other languages.

```rust
if env.os == HostOS::Windows {
    // Windows only
}

if env.arch == HostArch::Arm64 {
    // aarch64 only
}
```

Furthermore, the user's home directory (`~`) and proto's root directory (`~/.proto`) can be accessed
with the `home_dir` and `proto_dir` fields, both of which are [virtual paths](#virtual-paths).

```rust
if env.home_dir.join(some_path).exists() {
    // Do something
}
```

### Host functions

WASM is pretty powerful but it can't do everything since it's sandboxed. To work around this, we
provide a mechanism known as host functions, which are functions that are implemented on the host
(in Rust), and can be executed from WASM. The following host functions are currently available:

- [`exec_command`](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/macro.exec_command.html) - Execute a
  system command on the host machine, with a provided list of arguments or environment variables.
- [`host_log`](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/macro.host_log.html) - Log a message to
  the host's stderr. This acts like tracing logs, and is not a general purpose stdout logger.

To use host functions, you'll need to make them available by registering them at the top of your
Rust file (only add the functions you want to use).

```rust
#[host_fn]
extern "ExtismHost" {
    fn exec_command(input: Json<ExecCommandInput>) -> Json<ExecCommandOutput>;
    fn host_log(input: Json<HostLogInput>);
}
```

And then calling the provided `exec_command!` or `host_log!` macros. Each macro supports shorthand
variants, and an explicit variant that accepts the input struct.

```rust
exec_command!("which", ["node"]);
exec_command!(pipe, "npm", ["install"]); // Pipe stdout/stderr
exec_command!(inherit, "npm", ["install"]); // Inherit stdout/stderr
exec_command!(ExecCommandInput {
    command: "npm".into(),
    args: vec!["install".into()],
    env_vars: HashMap::new(),
    stream: false,
});
```

```rust
host_log!("Some message");
host_log!("Some message with {}", "args");
host_log!(HostLogInput::Fields {
    message: "Some message with data".into(),
    data: HashMap::from_iter([
        ("data".into(), serde_json::to_value(data)?),
    ]),
});
```

### Tool ID and context

When implementing plugin functions, you'll need to access information about the current tool. To get
the current tool ID (the key the plugin was configured with), use the
[`get_tool_id`](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/fn.get_tool_id.html) function.

```rust
let id = get_tool_id();
```

Additionally, we also provide what we call the tool context, which is information that is constantly
changing depending on the current step or state of proto's execution. The context cannot be accessed
with a stand-alone function, and is instead passed as a `context` field in the input of many plugin
functions.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn download_prebuilt(Json(input): Json<DownloadPrebuiltInput>) -> FnResult<Json<DownloadPrebuiltOutput>> {
    let version = input.context.version;
    // ...
}
```

The following fields are available on the
[context object](https://docs.rs/proto_pdk/latest/proto_pdk/struct.ToolContext.html):

- `env_vars` - A map of environment variables requested by the
  [`register_tool`](#registering-metadata) function.
- `tool_dir` - A virtual path to the tool's directory for the current version.
- `version` - The current version. If not resolved, will be "latest".

## Create a plugin

:::info

Although plugins can be written in any language that compiles to WASM, we've only tested Rust. The
rest of this article assume you're using Rust and Cargo! Refer to [Extism](https://extism.org/)'s
documentation or our official [Node.js plugin](https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin) for other
examples.

:::

To start, create a new crate with Cargo:

```shell
cargo new plugin --lib
cd plugin
```

And set the lib type to `cdylib`.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ['cdylib']
```

Our Rust plugins are powered by [Extism](https://extism.org/), so lets add their PDK and ours as a
dependency.

```shell
cargo add extism-pdk proto_pdk
```

In all Rust files, we can import both PDKs with the following:

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use extism_pdk::*;
use proto_pdk::*;
```

We can then build the WASM binary. The file will be available at
`target/wasm32-wasi/debug/<name>.wasm`.

```shell
cargo install cargo-wasi
cargo wasi build
```

## Implementing plugin functions

Plugins are powered by a set of functions that are called from the host, and are annotated with
`#[plugin_fn]`.

### Registering metadata

The first step in a plugin's life-cycle is to register metadata about the plugin with the
`register_tool` function. This function is called immediately after a plugin is loaded at runtime,
and must return a human-readable name and plugin type.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn register_tool(_: ()) -> FnResult<Json<ToolMetadataOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(ToolMetadataOutput {
        name: "Node.js".into(),
        type_of: PluginType::Language,
        plugin_version: Some(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()),
        ..ToolMetadataOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

This function also receives the plugin ID as input, allowing for conditional logic based on the ID.
The ID is the [key the plugin was configured with](#enabling-plugins), and what is passed to `proto`
commands (e.g. `proto install <id>`).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn register_tool(Json(input): Json<ToolMetadataInput>) -> FnResult<Json<ToolMetadataOutput>> {
  input.id
  // ...
}
```

### Downloading pre-builts

Our plugin layer _only_ supports downloading pre-built tools, typically as an archive, and does
_not_ support building from source. The `download_prebuilt` function _must_ be defined, whichs
configures how the tool should be downloaded and installed.

The following fields are available:

- `archive_prefix` - If the tool is distributed as an archive (zip, tar, etc), this is the name of
  the direct folder within the archive that contains the tool, and will be removed when unpacking
  the archive. If there is no prefix folder within the archive, this setting can be omitted.
- `download_url` (required) - A secure URL to download the tool/archive.
- `download_name` - File name of the archive to download. If not provided, will attempt to extract
  it from the URL.
- `checksum_url` - A secure URL to download the checksum file for verification. If the tool does not
  support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn download_prebuilt(Json(input): Json<DownloadPrebuiltInput>) -> FnResult<Json<DownloadPrebuiltOutput>> {
     let env = get_proto_environment()?;

    check_supported_os_and_arch(
        NAME,
        &env,
        permutations! [
            HostOS::Linux => [HostArch::X64, HostArch::Arm64, HostArch::Arm, HostArch::Powerpc64, HostArch::S390x],
            HostOS::MacOS => [HostArch::X64, HostArch::Arm64],
            HostOS::Windows => [HostArch::X64, HostArch::X86, HostArch::Arm64],
        ],
    )?;

    let version = input.context.version;
    let arch = env.arch;
    let os = env.os;

    let prefix = match os {
        HostOS::Linux => format!("node-v{version}-linux-{arch}"),
        HostOS::MacOS => format!("node-v{version}-darwin-{arch}"),
        HostOS::Windows => format!("node-v{version}-win-{arch}"),
        other => {
            return Err(PluginError::UnsupportedPlatform("Node.js".into(), other.into()))?;
        }
    };

    let filename = if os == HostOS::Windows {
        format!("{prefix}.zip")
    } else {
        format!("{prefix}.tar.xz")
    };

    Ok(Json(DownloadPrebuiltOutput {
        archive_prefix: Some(prefix),
        download_url: format!("https://nodejs.org/dist/v{version}/{filename}"),
        download_name: Some(filename),
        checksum_url: Some(format!("https://nodejs.org/dist/v{version}/SHASUMS256.txt")),
        ..DownloadPrebuiltOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

#### Unpacking an archive

Our plugin layer will do its best to detect file extensions, unpack the downloaded file (if an
archive), and install the tool to the correct directory. However, we're unable to account for _all_
edge cases, so for situations where the install params above are not sufficient, you may define an
`unpack_archive` function.

This function receives an input with the following fields:

- `input_file` - Virtual path to the downloaded file. Maps to `~/.proto/temp/<id>/<file>`.
- `output_dir` - Virtual directory to unpack the archive into, or copy the binary to. Maps to
  `~/.proto/tools/<id>/<version>`.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn unpack_archive(Json(input): Json<UnpackArchiveInput>) -> FnResult<()> {
    untar(input.input_file, input.output_dir)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Locating binaries

Even though a tool has been installed, we must inform proto of where to find the binary to execute.
This can be achieved with the optional `locate_bins` function. If this function is not defined,
proto will assume the binary is named `<id>` (`<id>.exe` on Windows), relative from the installation
directory.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn locate_bins(Json(_): Json<LocateBinsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LocateBinsOutput>> {
    let env = get_proto_environment()?;

    Ok(Json(LocateBinsOutput {
        bin_path: Some(if env.os == HostOS::Windows {
            "node.exe".into()
        } else {
            "bin/node".into()
        }),
        ..LocateBinsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

Furthermore, the `locate_bins` function can define a list of lookups for the globals installation
directory. proto will loop through each lookup, and return the first directory that exists on the
current file system. proto will also expand environment variables in the format of `$VAR_NAME`. If a
variable is not defined, or has an empty value, the lookup will be skipped. To demonstrate this,
we'll use [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.0/tools/script_installer).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn locate_bins(Json(_): Json<LocateBinsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LocateBinsOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(LocateBinsOutput {
        fallback_last_globals_dir: true,
        globals_lookup_dirs: vec!["$DENO_INSTALL_ROOT/bin".into(), "$HOME/.deno/bin".into()],
        ..LocateBinsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

### Loading and resolving versions

Now that the tool can be downloaded and installed, we must configure how to resolve available
versions to actually be installed. To provide a list of versions and language specific aliases, the
`load_versions` function must be defined.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn load_versions(Json(_): Json<LoadVersionsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LoadVersionsOutput>> {
    let mut output = LoadVersionsOutput::default();
    let response: Vec<NodeDistVersion> = fetch_url("https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json")?;

    for (index, item) in response.iter().enumerate() {
        let version = Version::parse(&item.version[1..])?; // Starts with v

        if index == 0 {
            output.latest = Some(version.clone());
        }

        output.versions.push(version);
    }

    Ok(Json(output))
}
```

Furthermore, we support an optional function named `resolve_version`, that can be defined to
intercept the version resolution process. This function receives an input with an initial candidate,
either an alias or version, and can replace it with a new candidate. The candidate must be a valid
alias or version as defined in `load_versions`.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn resolve_version(
    Json(input): Json<ResolveVersionInput>,
) -> FnResult<Json<ResolveVersionOutput>> {
    let mut output = ResolveVersionOutput::default();

    if input.initial == "node" {
        output.candidate = Some("latest".into());

    } else if input.initial == "lts-*" || input.initial == "lts/*" {
        output.candidate = Some("stable".into());

    } else if input.initial.starts_with("lts-") || input.initial.starts_with("lts/") {
        output.candidate = Some(input.initial[4..].to_owned());
    }

    Ok(Json(output))
}
```

### Detecting versions

And lastly, we can configure how to [detect a version](./detection) contextually at runtime, using
the `detect_version_files` function and optional `parse_version_file` function. The
`detect_version_files` function can return a list of files to locate within a directory.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn detect_version_files(_: ()) -> FnResult<Json<DetectVersionOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(DetectVersionOutput {
        files: vec![
            ".nvmrc".into(),
            ".node-version".into(),
            "package.json".into(),
        ],
    }))
}
```

By default our plugin layer will assume the version file's contents contain the literal version, and
nothing else, like "1.2.3". If any of the files in the `detect_version_files` list require custom
parsing (for example, `package.json` above), you can define the `parse_version_file` function.

This function receives the file name and contents as input, and must return the parsed version (if
applicable).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn parse_version_file(Json(input): Json<ParseVersionFileInput>) -> FnResult<Json<ParseVersionFileOutput>> {
    let mut version = None;

    if input.file == "package.json" {
        let json: PackageJson = serde_json::from_str(&input.content)?;

        if let Some(engines) = json.engines {
            if let Some(constraint) = engines.get("node") {
                version = Some(constraint.to_owned());
            }
        }
    } else {
        version = Some(input.content.trim().to_owned());
    }

    Ok(Json(ParseVersionFileOutput { version }))
}
```

### Creating shims

Tools within proto wouldn't function without shims, and as such, plugins can register their own
shims to be created. By default, proto _will always_ create a global shim of the plugin at
`~/.proto/bin/<id>`, but you can also register additional shims with the `create_shims` function.

#### Global shims

Global shims are optional scripts that are available on `PATH` as they are generated in the
`~/.proto/bin` directory, and can be defined with the `global_shims` parameter. This param is a hash
map, where the key is the shim file name, and the value is a configuration object.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn create_shims(Json(_): Json<CreateShimsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<CreateShimsOutput>> {
    let env = get_proto_environment()?;
    let mut global_shims = HashMap::new();

    global_shims.insert(
        "npx".into(),
        ShimConfig::global_with_alt_bin(if env.os == HostOS::Windows {
            "npx.cmd".into()
        } else {
            "bin/npx".into()
        }),
    );

    Ok(Json(CreateShimsOutput {
        global_shims,
        ..CreateShimsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

Furthermore, if you'd prefer to _not_ create a primary global shim at all, enable the
`no_primary_global` field.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn create_shims(Json(_): Json<CreateShimsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<CreateShimsOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(CreateShimsOutput {
        no_primary_global: true,
        ..CreateShimsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

### Installing and uninstalling globals

Most languages support the concept of installing packages/dependencies globally, and making them
available on `PATH`. proto supports this with the
[`proto install-global`](./commands/install-global) and
[`proto uninstall-global`](./commands/uninstall-global) commands, which are simple convenience
wrappers around the native binary.

From the context of the plugin, how globals are installed and uninstalled is implemented with the
`install_global` and `uninstall_global` functions respectively. Both functions receive the
`dependency` to install as input.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn install_global(
    Json(input): Json<InstallGlobalInput>,
) -> FnResult<Json<InstallGlobalOutput>> {
    let result = exec_command!(inherit, "npm", ["install", "--global", &input.dependency]);

    Ok(Json(InstallGlobalOutput::from_exec_command(result)))
}

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn uninstall_global(
    Json(input): Json<UninstallGlobalInput>,
) -> FnResult<Json<UninstallGlobalOutput>> {
    let result = exec_command!(inherit, "npm", ["uninstall", "--global", &input.dependency]);

    Ok(Json(UninstallGlobalOutput::from_exec_command(result)))
}
```

## Testing

The best way to test the plugin is to execute it through `proto` directly. To do this, you'll need
to configure a `.prototools` file at the root of your plugin's repository that maps the plugin to a
debug build:

```toml
[plugins]
<id> = "source:target/wasm32-wasi/debug/<name>.wasm"
```

And everytime you make a change to the plugin, you'll need to rebuild it with:

```shell
cargo wasi build
```

With these 2 pieces in place, you can now execute `proto` commands. Be sure you're running them from
the directory with the `.prototools` file, and that you're passing `--log trace`. Logs are extremely
helpful for figuring out what's going on.

```shell
proto --log trace install <id>
proto --log trace list-remote <id>
...
```

### Unit tests

Testing WASM plugins is a bit tricky, but we've taken it upon ourselves to streamline this process
as much as possible with built-in test utilities, and Rust macros for generating common test cases.
To begin, install all necessary development dependencies:

```shell
cargo add --dev proto_core proto_pdk_test_utils starbase_sandbox tokio
```

And as mentioned above, everytime you make a change to the plugin, you'll need to rebuild it with:

```shell
cargo wasi build
```

#### Testing plugin functions

The common test case is simply calling plugin functions with a provided input and asserting the
output is correct. This can be achieved by creating a plugin instance with `create_plugin` and
calling the appropriate method.

```rust
use proto_pdk_test_utils::*;
use starbase_sandbox::create_empty_sandbox;

#[test]
fn registers_metadata() {
    let sandbox = create_empty_sandbox();
    let plugin = create_plugin("id", sandbox.path());

    assert_eq!(
        plugin.register_tool(ToolMetadataInput::default()),
        ToolMetadataOutput {
            name: "Name".into(),
            ..ToolMetadataOutput::default()
        }
    );
}
```

:::info

We suggest using this pattern for static functions that return a deterministic output from a
provided input, and not for dynamic functions that make HTTP requests or execute host commands.

:::

#### Generating cases from macros

To reduce the burden of writing custom tests for common flows, like downloading a pre-built,
resolving versions, and generating shims, we provide a set of Rust decl macros that will generate
the tests for you.

To test downloading and installing, use `generate_download_install_tests!`. This macro requires a
plugin ID and a real version to test with.

```rust
use proto_pdk_test_utils::*;
use starbase_sandbox::create_empty_sandbox;

generate_download_install_tests!("id", "1.2.3");
```

To test version resolving, use `generate_resolve_versions_tests!`. This macro requires a plugin ID,
and a mapping of version/aliases assertions to expectations.

```rust
generate_resolve_versions_tests!("id", {
    "0.4" => "0.4.12",
    "0.5.1" => "0.5.1",
    "stable" => "1.0.0",
});
```

To test installing and uninstalling globals, use `generate_globals_test!`. This macro requires a
plugin ID, the dependency to install, and an optional environment variable to the globals directory.

```rust
// Doesn't support all use cases! If this doesn't work, implement a test case manually.
generate_globals_test!("id", "dependency", "GLOBAL_INSTALL_ROOT");
```

And lastly, to test shims, use `generate_global_shims_test!` or `generate_local_shims_test!`. Both
macros require a plugin ID, but also support additional arguments when creating more than 1 shim.
These macros generate snapshots using [Insta](https://insta.rs/).

```rust
// Only the single binary
generate_global_shims_test!("id");

// When creating alternate/additional globals
generate_global_shims_test!("id", ["other", "another"]);

// When creating local shims, each file required in the list
generate_local_shims_test!("id", ["a", "b", "c"]);
```

## Building and publishing

At this point, you should have a fully working WASM plugin, but to make it available to downstream
proto users, you'll still need to build and make the `.wasm` file available. The easiest solution is
to publish a GitHub release and include the `.wasm` file as an asset.

### Manually create releases

When your plugin is ready to be published, you can create a release on GitHub using the following
steps.

1. Tag the release and push to GitHub.

```shell
git tag v0.0.1
git push --tags
```

2. Build a release version of the plugin. The file will be available at
   `target/wasm32-wasi/release/<name>.wasm`.

```shell
cargo wasi build --release
```

3. In GitHub, navigate to the tags page, find the new tag, create a new release, and attach the
   built file as an asset.

### Automate releases

Coming soon!

<!--
If you'd prefer to automate all releases, we suggest using
[`cargo-dist`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-dist) for Rust based plugins. The `cargo-dist` crate
will scaffold a GitHub workflow that automatically builds the project and creates a GitHub release
everytime a tag is created.

We won't guide you through the process of setting up `cargo-dist`, but you can see an example of the
`Cargo.toml` configuration below.

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dist]
cargo-dist-version = "0.0.7"
ci = ["github"]
targets = ["wasm32-wasi"]
installers = []
```
