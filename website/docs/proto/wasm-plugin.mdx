Plugins can also be written in [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/), a portable binary
format. This means that plugins can be written in any language that compiles to WASM, like Rust, C,
C++, Go, TypeScript, and more. Because WASM based plugins are powered by a programming language,
they implicitly support complex business logic and behavior, have access to a sandboxed file system,
can execute child processes, and much more.

However, since WASM executes in its own runtime, it _does not_ have access to the current host
operating system, architecture, environment variables, and more. To bridge this gap, we provide this
information as an `env` field for every function input (more below).

Since our WASM plugin implementation is still experimental, expect breaking changes to occur in
non-major releases.

## Create a plugin

:::info

Although plugins can be written in any language that compiles to WASM, we've only tested Rust. The
rest of this article assume you're using Rust and Cargo! Refer to [Extism](https://extism.org/)'s
documentation or our official [Node.js plugin](https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin) for other
examples.

:::

To start, create a new crate with Cargo:

```shell
cargo new plugin --lib
cd plugin
```

And set the lib type to `cdylib`.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ['cdylib']
```

Our Rust plugins are powered by [Extism](https://extism.org/), so lets add their PDK and ours as a
dependency.

```shell
cargo add extism-pdk proto_pdk
```

In all Rust files, we can import both PDKs with the following:

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use extism_pdk::*;
use proto_pdk::*;
```

We can then build the WASM binary. The file will be available at
`target/wasm32-wasi/debug/<name>.wasm`.

```shell
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi
```

### Registering metadata

The first step in a plugin's life-cycle is to register metadata about the plugin with the
`register_tool` function. This function is called immediately after a plugin is loaded at runtime,
and must return a human-readable name and plugin type.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn register_tool(_: ()) -> FnResult<Json<ToolMetadataOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(ToolMetadataOutput {
        name: "Node.js".into(),
        type_of: PluginType::Language,
        ..ToolMetadataOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

This function also receives the plugin ID as input, allowing for conditional logic based on the ID.
The ID is the [key the plugin was configured with](#enabling-plugins), and what is passed to `proto`
commands (e.g. `proto install <id>`).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn register_tool(Json(input): Json<ToolMetadataInput>) -> FnResult<Json<ToolMetadataOutput>> {
  input.id
  // ...
}
```

### Downloading pre-builts

Our plugin layer _only_ supports downloading pre-built tools, typically as an archive, and does
_not_ support building from source. The `download_prebuilt` function _must_ be defined, whichs
configures how the tool should be downloaded and installed.

The following fields are available:

- `archive_prefix` - If the tool is distributed as an archive (zip, tar, etc), this is the name of
  the direct folder within the archive that contains the tool, and will be removed when unpacking
  the archive. If there is no prefix folder within the archive, this setting can be omitted.
- `download_url` (required) - A secure URL to download the tool/archive.
- `download_name` - File name of the archive to download. If not provided, will attempt to extract
  it from the URL.
- `checksum_url` - A secure URL to download the checksum file for verification. If the tool does not
  support checksum verification, this setting can be omitted.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn download_prebuilt(Json(input): Json<DownloadPrebuiltInput>) -> FnResult<Json<DownloadPrebuiltOutput>> {
    let version = input.env.version;
    let arch = input.env.arch;
    let os = input.env.os;

    let prefix = match os {
        HostOS::Linux => format!("node-v{version}-linux-{arch}"),
        HostOS::MacOS => format!("node-v{version}-darwin-{arch}"),
        HostOS::Windows => format!("node-v{version}-win-{arch}"),
        other => {
            return Err(PluginError::UnsupportedPlatform("Node.js".into(), other.into()))?;
        }
    };

    let filename = if os == HostOS::Windows {
        format!("{prefix}.zip")
    } else {
        format!("{prefix}.tar.xz")
    };

    Ok(Json(DownloadPrebuiltOutput {
        archive_prefix: Some(prefix),
        download_url: format!("https://nodejs.org/dist/v{version}/{filename}"),
        download_name: Some(filename),
        checksum_url: Some(format!("https://nodejs.org/dist/v{version}/SHASUMS256.txt")),
        ..DownloadPrebuiltOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

#### Unpacking an archive

Our plugin layer will do its best to detect file extensions, unpack the downloaded file (if an
archive), and install the tool to the correct directory. However, we're unable to account for _all_
edge cases, so for situations where the install params above are not sufficient, you may define an
`unpack_archive` function.

This function receives an input with the following fields:

- `input_file` - Virtual path to the downloaded file. Maps to `~/.proto/temp/<id>/<file>`.
- `output_dir` - Virtual directory to unpack the archive into, or copy the binary to. Maps to
  `~/.proto/tools/<id>/<version>`.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn unpack_archive(Json(input): Json<UnpackArchiveInput>) -> FnResult<()> {
    untar(input.input_file, input.output_dir)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Locating binaries

Even though a tool has been installed, we must inform proto of where to find the binary to execute.
This can be achieved with the optional `locate_bins` function. If this function is not defined,
proto will assume the binary is named `<id>` (`<id>.exe` on Windows), relative from the installation
directory.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn locate_bins(Json(input): Json<LocateBinsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LocateBinsOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(LocateBinsOutput {
        bin_path: Some(if input.env.os == HostOS::Windows {
            "node.exe".into()
        } else {
            "bin/node".into()
        }),
        ..LocateBinsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

Furthermore, the `locate_bins` function can define a list of lookups for the globals installation
directory. proto will loop through each lookup, and return the first directory that exists on the
current file system. proto will also expand environment variables in the format of `$VAR_NAME`. If a
variable is not defined, or has an empty value, the lookup will be skipped. To demonstrate this,
we'll use [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.0/tools/script_installer).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn locate_bins(Json(_): Json<LocateBinsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LocateBinsOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(LocateBinsOutput {
        globals_lookup_dirs: vec!["$DENO_INSTALL_ROOT/bin".into(), "$HOME/.deno/bin".into()],
        ..LocateBinsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

### Loading and resolving versions

Now that the tool can be downloaded and installed, we must configure how to resolve available
versions to actually be installed. To provide a list of versions and language specific aliases, the
`load_versions` function must be defined.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn load_versions(Json(_): Json<LoadVersionsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<LoadVersionsOutput>> {
    let mut output = LoadVersionsOutput::default();
    let response: Vec<NodeDistVersion> = fetch_url("https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json")?;

    for (index, item) in response.iter().enumerate() {
        let version = Version::parse(&item.version[1..])?; // Starts with v

        if index == 0 {
            output.latest = Some(version.clone());
        }

        output.versions.push(version);
    }

    Ok(Json(output))
}
```

Furthermore, we support an optional function named `resolve_version`, that can be defined to
intercept the version resolution process. This function receives an input with an initial candidate,
either an alias or version, and can replace it with a new candidate. The candidate must be a valid
alias or version as defined in `load_versions`.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn resolve_version(
    Json(input): Json<ResolveVersionInput>,
) -> FnResult<Json<ResolveVersionOutput>> {
    let mut output = ResolveVersionOutput::default();

    if input.initial == "node" {
        output.candidate = Some("latest".into());

    } else if input.initial == "lts-*" || input.initial == "lts/*" {
        output.candidate = Some("stable".into());

    } else if input.initial.starts_with("lts-") || input.initial.starts_with("lts/") {
        output.candidate = Some(input.initial[4..].to_owned());
    }

    Ok(Json(output))
}
```

### Detecting versions

And lastly, we can configure how to [detect a version](./detection) contextually at runtime, using
the `detect_version_files` function and optional `parse_version_file` function. The
`detect_version_files` function can return a list of files to locate within a directory.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn detect_version_files(_: ()) -> FnResult<Json<DetectVersionOutput>> {
    Ok(Json(DetectVersionOutput {
        files: vec![
            ".nvmrc".into(),
            ".node-version".into(),
            "package.json".into(),
        ],
    }))
}
```

By default our plugin layer will assume the version file's contents contain the literal version, and
nothing else, like "1.2.3". If any of the files in the `detect_version_files` list require custom
parsing (for example, `package.json` above), you can define the `parse_version_file` function.

This function receives the file name and contents as input, and must return the parsed version (if
applicable).

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn parse_version_file(Json(input): Json<ParseVersionInput>) -> FnResult<Json<ParseVersionOutput>> {
    let mut version = None;

    if input.file == "package.json" {
        let json: PackageJson = serde_json::from_str(&input.content)?;

        if let Some(engines) = json.engines {
            if let Some(constraint) = engines.get("node") {
                version = Some(constraint.to_owned());
            }
        }
    } else {
        version = Some(input.content.trim().to_owned());
    }

    Ok(Json(ParseVersionOutput { version }))
}
```

### Creating shims

Tools within proto wouldn't function without shims, and as such, plugins can register their own
shims to be created. By default, proto _will always_ create a global shim of the plugin at
`~/.proto/bin/<id>`, but you can also register additional shims with the `create_shims` function.

#### Global shims

Global shims are optional scripts that are available on `PATH` as they are generated in the
`~/.proto/bin` directory, and can be defined with the `global_shims` parameter. This param is a hash
map, where the key is the shim file name, and the value is a relative path (from the tool's
directory) to a binary to execute.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn create_shims(Json(input): Json<CreateShimsInput>) -> FnResult<Json<CreateShimsOutput>> {
    let mut global_shims = HashMap::new();

    global_shims.insert("npx".into(), if input.env.os == HostOS::Windows {
        "npx.cmd".into()
    } else {
        "bin/npx".into()
    });

    Ok(Json(CreateShimsOutput {
        global_shims,
        ..CreateShimsOutput::default()
    }))
}
```

### Testing

TODO

#### Unit tests

Coming soon...

### Building and publishing

At this point, you should have a fully working WASM plugin, but to make it available to downstream
proto users, you'll still need to build and make the `.wasm` file available. The easiest solution is
to publish a GitHub release and include the `.wasm` file as an asset.

#### Manually create releases

When your plugin is ready to be published, you can create a release on GitHub using the following
steps.

1. Tag the release and push to GitHub.

```shell
git tag v0.0.1
git push --tags
```

2. Build a release version of the plugin. The file will be available at
   `target/wasm32-wasi/release/<name>.wasm`.

```shell
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

3. In GitHub, navigate to the tags page, find the new tag, create a new release, and attach the
   built file as an asset.

#### Automate releases

If you'd prefer to automate all releases, we suggest using
[`cargo-dist`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-dist) for Rust based plugins. The `cargo-dist` crate
will scaffold a GitHub workflow that automatically builds the project and creates a GitHub release
everytime a tag is created.

We won't guide you through the process of setting up `cargo-dist`, but you can see an example of the
`Cargo.toml` configuration below.

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dist]
cargo-dist-version = "0.0.7"
ci = ["github"]
targets = ["wasm32-wasi"]
installers = []
```

#### Test release

Once the `.wasm` file is publicly available, we can verify that it works correctly in proto by
configuring it as a plugin in [`.prototools`](./config).

```toml
[plugins]
my-plugin = "source:https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/<version>/<name>.wasm"
```

```shell
proto install my-plugin
```
