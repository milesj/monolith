We support configuration at both the project-level and user-level using a
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) based `.prototools` file. This file can be used to pin versions of
tools, provide tool specific configuration, enable new tools via plugins, define proto settings, and
more.

## Resolution order

When a `proto` command or shim is ran, we load the `.prototools` file in the current directory, and
traverse upwards loading `.prototools` within each directory, until we reach the system root or the
user directory (`~`), whichever comes first. Once complete, we then load the special
`~/.proto/.prototools` file, which acts as configuration at the user-level and includes fallback
settings. This operation may look like the following:

```text
~/Projects/web-app/packages/components/src/.prototools
~/Projects/web-app/packages/components/.prototools
~/Projects/web-app/packages/.prototools
~/Projects/web-app/.prototools
~/Projects/.prototools
~/.prototools
~/.proto/.prototools
```

We then deeply merge all of these configuration files into a final configuration object, with the
current directory taking highest precedence.

## Pinning versions

proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-directory basis through our `.prototools`
configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection) and can be
created/updated with [`proto pin`](./commands/pin).

At its most basic level, you can map tools to specific versions, for the directory the file is
located in. A version can either be a fully-qualified semantic version, a partial version, a range
or requirement, or an alias.

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9"
go = "~1.20"
rust = "stable"
```

## Available settings

### `[plugins]`

Additional [plugins](./plugins) can be configured with the `[plugins]` section.
[Learn more about this syntax](./plugins#enabling-plugins).

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
my-tool = "source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my/tool/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

Once configured, you can run a plugin as if it was a built-in tool:

```shell
$ proto install my-tool
```

### `[settings]`

#### `auto-install`

When enabled, will automatically installing missing tools when [`proto run`](./commands/run) is run,
instead of erroring. Defaults to `false` or `PROTO_AUTO_INSTALL`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
auto-install = true
```

#### `auto-clean`

When enabled, will automatically clean up the proto cache when [`proto use`](./commands/use) is run.
Defaults to `false` or `PROTO_AUTO_CLEAN`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
auto-clean = true
```

#### `detect-strategy`

The strategy to use when [detecting versions](./detection). Defaults to `first-available` or
`PROTO_DETECT_STRATEGY`.

- `first-available` - Will use the first available version that is found. Either from `.prototools`
  or a tool specific file (`.nvmrc`, etc).
- `prefer-prototools` - Prefer a `.prototools` version, even if found in a parent directory. If none
  found, falls back to tool specific file.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
detect-strategy = "prefer-prototools"
```

#### `pin-latest`

When defined and a tool is installed with the "latest" version, will automatically pin the resolved
version to the configured location. Defaults to disabled or `PROTO_PIN_LATEST`.

- `global` - Pins globally to `~/.proto/.prototools`.
- `local` - Pins locally to `.prototools` in current directory.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings]
pin-latest = "local"
```

#### `[http]`

Can be used to customize the HTTP client used by proto, primarily for requesting files to download,
available versions, and more.

##### `allow-invalid-certs`

When enabled, will allow invalid certificates instead of failing. This is an _escape hatch_ and
should only be used if other settings have failed. Be sure you know what you're doing! Defaults to
`false`.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
allow-invalid-certs = true
```

##### `proxies`

A list of proxy URLs to use for requests.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
proxies = ["https://internal.proxy", "https://corp.net/proxy"]
```

##### `root-cert`

The path to a root certificate to use for requests. This is useful for overriding the native
certificate, or for using a self-signed certificate, especially when in a corporate/internal
environment. Supports `pem` and `der` files.

```toml title=".prototools"
[settings.http]
root-cert = "/path/to/root/cert.pem"
```

## Tool specific settings

### `[tools.*]`

Tools support custom configuration that will be passed to their WASM plugin, which can be used to
control the business logic within the plugin. Please refer to the [official documentation](./tools)
for each tool (typically on their repository) for a list of available settings.

As an example, let's configure [Node.js](https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin) (using the `node`
identifier).

```toml title=".prototools"
[tools.node]
bundled-npm = false
intercept-globals = false
```

### `[tools.*.aliases]`

Aliases are custom and unique labels that map to a specific version, and can be configured manually
within `.prototools`, or by calling the [`proto alias`](./commands/alias) command.

```toml title=".prototools"
[tools.node.aliases]
work = "18"
oss = "20"
```

## GitHub Action

To streamline GitHub CI workflows, we provide the
[`moonrepo/setup-toolchain`](https://github.com/moonrepo/setup-toolchain) action, which can be used
to install `proto` globally, and cache the toolchain found at `~/.proto`.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'
      - uses: 'moonrepo/setup-toolchain@v0'
      - run: 'proto use'
```
