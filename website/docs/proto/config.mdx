We support configuration for both projects and users. Both config files are in
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

## Project configuration

proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-project or per-directory basis through our
`.prototools` configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection)
and can be created/updated with [`proto local`](./commands/local).

This configuration simply maps tools to semantic versions for the current directory.

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9.0.0"
go = "1.20"
rust = "1.68"
```

> The names of tools are the same used on the command line!

## User configuration

proto operates with sane defaults and accomplishes its goals very well. However, we also believe in
user choice and customization, and as such, support a user configuration file located at
`~/.proto/config.toml`, which can be used to customize the behavior of proto.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
auto-install = true
```

#### Available settings:

- `auto-install` - When enabled, will automatically installing missing tools when
  [`proto run`](./commands/run) is run, instead of erroring. Defaults to `false`.
