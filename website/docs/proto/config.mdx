proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-project or per-directory basis through our
`.prototools` configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection)
and can be created/updated with [`proto local`](./commands/local).

This configuration simply maps tools to semantic versions for the current directory. This file is in
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/), which is pretty straight forward if you've never used it before, for
example:

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9.0.0"
go = "1.20"
```

> The names of tools are the same used on the command line!
