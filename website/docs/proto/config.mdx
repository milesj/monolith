We support configuration for both projects and users. Both config files are in
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

## Project configuration

proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-project or per-directory basis through our
`.prototools` configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection)
and can be created/updated with [`proto local`](./commands/local).

This configuration simply maps tools to semantic versions for the current directory.

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9.0.0"
go = "1.20"
rust = "1.68"
```

> The names of tools are the same used on the command line!

### Plugins

Plugins can also be configured on a per-project basis, by defining a `[plugins]` section, that maps
a plugin to a locator string. The map key is the plugin name _in kebab-case_, which is used as the
binary/tool name in proto, and also the name for configuration and cache purposes. The map value is
a locator string that defines a protocol and source location, and supports the following formats:

- `schema:<location>` - A [TOML plugin](./plugins#toml-plugin). The location is either an `https://`
  URL, or a file path relative from the parent configuration.

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
my-tool = "schema:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my/tool/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

Once configured, you can run a plugin as if it was a built-in tool:

```shell
$ proto install my-tool
```

## User configuration

proto operates with sane defaults and accomplishes its goals very well. However, we also believe in
user choice and customization, and as such, support a user configuration file located at
`~/.proto/config.toml`, which can be used to customize the behavior of proto.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
auto-install = true
```

These settings (excluding plugins) can also be configured via environment variables.

```shell
PROTO_AUTO_INSTALL=true proto run node
```

### Settings

- `auto-install` - When enabled, will automatically installing missing tools when
  [`proto run`](./commands/run) is run, instead of erroring. Defaults to `false`.
- `auto-clean` - When enabled, will automatically clean up the proto cache when
  [`proto use`](./commands/use) is run. Defaults to `false`.
- `node-intercept-globals` - When enabled, will intercept global package installs for npm/pnpm/yarn
  and suggest using [`proto install-global`](./commands/install-global) instead. Defaults to `true`.
- `[plugins]` - A mapping of plugins available to the user. Refer to the [plugins](#plugins) section
  above for more information.

## GitHub Action

To streamline GitHub CI workflows, we provide the
[`moonrepo/setup-proto`](https://github.com/moonrepo/setup-proto) action, which can be used to
install `proto` globally, and cache the toolchain found at `~/.proto`.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v3'
      - uses: 'moonrepo/setup-proto@v0'
      - run: 'proto use'
```
