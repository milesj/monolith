We support configuration for both projects and users. Both config files are in
[TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

## Project configuration

proto supports pinning versions of tools on a per-project or per-directory basis through our
`.prototools` configuration file. This file takes precedence during [version detection](./detection)
and can be created/updated with [`proto local`](./commands/local).

This configuration simply maps tools to versions for the current directory.

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "16.16.0"
npm = "9"
go = "1.20"
rust = "1.68.0"
```

> The names of tools are the same used on the command line!

### `[plugins]`

[Plugins](./plugins) can also be configured with the `[plugins]` section.
[Learn more about this syntax](./plugins#enabling-plugins).

```toml title=".prototools"
[plugins]
my-tool = "source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my/tool/master/proto-plugin.toml"
```

Once configured, you can run a plugin as if it was a built-in tool:

```shell
$ proto install my-tool
```

## User configuration

proto operates with sane defaults and accomplishes its goals very well. However, we also believe in
user choice and customization, and as such, support a user configuration file located at
`~/.proto/config.toml`, which can be used to customize the behavior of proto.

Some of these settings (excluding plugins) can also be configured via environment variables.

```shell
PROTO_AUTO_INSTALL=true proto run node
```

### `auto-install`

When enabled, will automatically installing missing tools when [`proto run`](./commands/run) is run,
instead of erroring. Defaults to `false`.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
auto-install = true
```

### `auto-clean`

When enabled, will automatically clean up the proto cache when [`proto use`](./commands/use) is run.
Defaults to `false`.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
auto-clean = true
```

### `node-intercept-globals`

When enabled, will intercept global package installs for node/npm/pnpm/yarn and suggest using
[`proto install-global`](./commands/install-global) instead. Defaults to `true`.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
node-intercept-globals = false
```

### `[http]`

Can be used to customize the HTTP client used by proto and warpgate, primarily for requesting files
to download, available versions, and more. The following settings are available:

- `allow-invalid-certs` - When enabled, will allow invalid certificates instead of failing. This is
  an _escape hatch_ and should only be used if other settings have failed. Be sure you know what
  you're doing!
- `proxies` - A list of proxy URLs to use for requests.
- `root-cert` - The path to a root certificate to use for requests. This is useful for overriding
  the native certificate, or for using a self-signed certificate, especially when in a
  corporate/internal environment. Supports `pem` and `der` files.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
[http]
root-cert = "/path/to/root/cert.pem"
```

### `[plugins]`

A mapping of plugins available to the user, and not just a project/directory. Refer to the
[`[plugins]`](#plugins) section above for more information.

## GitHub Action

To streamline GitHub CI workflows, we provide the
[`moonrepo/setup-proto`](https://github.com/moonrepo/setup-proto) action, which can be used to
install `proto` globally, and cache the toolchain found at `~/.proto`.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v3'
      - uses: 'moonrepo/setup-proto@v1'
      - run: 'proto use'
```
