With proto, we provide multiple workflows for everyday use.

## Shims

proto is powered the by industry standard concept of shims. For each tool installed in proto, a shim
file will exist at `~/.proto/shims` for the primary executable, and some secondary executables.
Shims _are not_ symlinks to the tool's binary, but are thin wrappers around
[`proto run`](./commands/run), enabling [automatic version detection](./detection) on every
invocation! For example, these are equivalent:

```shell
$ proto run node -- --version
20.0.0

$ node --version
20.0.0

$ which node
~/.proto/shims/node
```

To make use of shims, prepend the `~/.proto/shims` directory to `PATH` in your shell profile. This
_must come before_ the [bin directory](#binary-linking) if using both.

## Binary linking

Alternatively, we also support a non-shim based approach, which creates symlinks to a versioned
tool's primary and secondary executables. For each tool installed in proto, a symlink will exist at
`~/.proto/bin` for the globally pinned version (found in [`~/.proto/.prototools`](./config)).

```shell
$ node --version
20.0.0

$ which node
~/.proto/bin/node -> /.proto/tools/node/20.0.0/bin/node
```

The version of a tool that's symlinked _is not_ dynamic, and is manually linked by pinning the
chosen version with [`proto install --pin=global`](./commands/install) or
[`proto pin --global`](./commands/pin). This also happens automatically the first time a tool is
installed.

To make use of bins, prepend the `~/.proto/bin` directory to PATH in your shell profile. This _must
come after_ the [shim directory](#shims) if using both.

:::info

Not all tools support symlinking a binary, as not all files are executable. For example, most
Node.js package managers currently do not support this, as JavaScript files are not executable
(especially on Windows). Shims are required for these tools.
