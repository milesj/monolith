With proto, we provide multiple workflows for everyday use for you to choose from. They can be used
individually, or together, it's up to you!

## Shims

proto is primarily powered the by industry standard concept of shims. For each tool installed in
proto, a shim file will exist at `~/.proto/shims` for the primary executable, and some secondary
executables. Shims _are not_ symlinks to the tool's binary, but are thin wrappers around
[`proto run`](./commands/run), enabling [runtime version detection](./detection) on every
invocation! For example, these are equivalent:

```shell
$ proto run node -- --version
20.0.0

$ node --version
20.0.0

$ which node
~/.proto/shims/node
```

To make use of shims, prepend the `~/.proto/shims` directory to `PATH` in your shell profile. This
_must come before_ the [bin directory](#binary-linking) if using both.

## Binary linking

Alternatively, we also support a non-shim based approach, which creates symlinks to a versioned
tool's primary and secondary executables. For each tool installed in proto, a symlink will exist at
`~/.proto/bin` for the globally pinned version (configured in [`~/.proto/.prototools`](./config)).

```shell
$ node --version
20.0.0

$ which node
~/.proto/bin/node -> /.proto/tools/node/20.0.0/bin/node
```

The version of a tool that's symlinked _is not_ dynamic and is manually linked by pinning the chosen
version with [`proto install --pin=global`](./commands/install) or
[`proto pin --global`](./commands/pin). This also happens automatically the first time a tool is
installed.

To make use of bins, prepend the `~/.proto/bin` directory to `PATH` in your shell profile. This
_must come after_ the [shim directory](#shims) if using both.

:::warning

Not all tools support symlinking a binary, as not all files are executable. For example, most
Node.js package managers currently do not support this, as JavaScript files are not executable
(especially on Windows). Shims are required for these tools.

## Shell activation<VersionLabel version="0.38.0" />

This feature is extremely experimental and may change based on feedback! If you run into any issues,
please report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto) or

:::

Our last workflow is what we call shell activation (or shell hooks), and its where the proto
environment is setup/reset every time you change directories. If you're coming from another version
manager, you may be familiar with this kind of workflow.

So how does this work exactly? In your shell profile, you'll evaluate a call to
[`proto activate <shell>`](./commands/activate), which generates a bunch of shell specific syntax
that registers a hook for "run this code when the current directory or prompt line changes". Once
this hook is registered and you run `cd` (for example), proto will load all tools and...

- Export environment variables based on [`[env]`](./config#env) and
  [`[tools.*.env]`](./config#toolsenv)
- Prepend `PATH` with tool-specific directories (like local and global executables) for the detected
  version

```shell
$ cd /some/path && node --version
20.0.0

$ cd /another/path && node --version
18.0.0
```

View the [`proto activate`](./commands/activate) documentation for information on how to setup your
shell profile for this workflow.

## Comparison

The workflows above may come across as information overload, so we've provided the following
comparison table outlining the features each workflow supports.
