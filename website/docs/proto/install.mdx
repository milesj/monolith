The following guide can be used to install proto into your environment.

## Requirements

- Git >= 2.22

## Installing

The entirety of proto is packaged and shipped as a single binary. It works on all _most_ operating
systems, and does not require any external dependencies. For convenience, we provide the following
scripts to download and install proto.

### Linux, macOS, WSL

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
```

### Windows

In an _administrator_ Powershell or Windows Terminal, run:

```
irm https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.ps1 | iex
```

You'll also need to run the following command for shims to be executable:

```shell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Without admin privileges
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

> Windows support is currently experimental. Please report any issues!

### Other

proto can also be downloaded and installed manually, by downloading an asset from
[https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases). Be sure to
rename the file after downloading, and apply the executable bit (`chmod +x`) on macOS and Linux.

## Upgrading

To upgrade proto, run the `proto upgrade` command, or re-run the install scripts above.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall proto, delete the `~/.proto` directory, and remove any `PROTO_ROOT` references from
your shell profile.
