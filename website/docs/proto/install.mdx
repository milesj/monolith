The following guide can be used to install proto into your environment.

## Installing

The entirety of proto is packaged and shipped as a single binary. It works on all _most_ operating
systems, and does not require any external dependencies. For convenience, we provide the following
scripts to download and install proto.

### Linux, macOS, WSL

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
```

### Windows

:::caution

Windows is blocked until we finalize better shim support. If you'd like to help, join us on Discord!

:::

### Other

proto can also be downloaded and installed manually, by downloading an asset from
[https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases). Be sure to
rename the file after downloading, and apply the executable bit (`chmod +x`) on macOS and Linux.

## Upgrading

We provide no formal mechanism for upgrading the proto binary. However, you can re-run the install
scripts above and it will download, install, and overwrite with the latest version.
