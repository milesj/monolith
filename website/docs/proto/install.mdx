The following guide can be used to install proto into your environment.

## Requirements

- Git >= 2.22

## Installing

The entirety of proto is packaged and shipped as a single binary. It works on _most_ operating
systems, and does not require any external dependencies. For convenience, we provide the following
scripts to download and install proto.

:::info

The install location can be customized with the `PROTO_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable.

:::

### Linux, macOS, WSL

In a terminal that supports Bash, run:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
```

### Windows

In an _administrator_ Powershell or Windows Terminal, run:

```
irm https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.ps1 | iex
```

You'll also need to run the following command for shims to be executable:

```shell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Without admin privileges
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

### Other

proto can also be downloaded and installed manually, by downloading an asset from
[https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases). Be sure to
rename the file after downloading, and apply the executable bit (`chmod +x`) on macOS and Linux.

## Upgrading

To upgrade proto, run the [`proto upgrade`](./commands/upgrade) command, or re-run the install
scripts above.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall proto, delete the `~/.proto` directory, and remove any `PROTO_HOME` references from
your shell profile.

## Canary releases

proto supports canary releases, which are built and published for every commit to our development
branches. These releases will include features and functionality that have not yet landed on master.
Canary releases are available as a
[GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/canary) using the `canary` tag.

## Nightly releases

proto supports nightly releases, which are built and published once a day from the latest commit on
master. Nightly releases are available as a
[GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/nightly) using the `nightly` tag.
