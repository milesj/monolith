With a [workspace](./setup-workspace), we can now house one or many [projects](./concepts/project),
with a project being an application, library, or tool. In the end, each project will have its own
build layer, personal tasks, and custom configuration.

## Declaring a project in the workspace

Although a project may exist in your repository, it's not accessible from Moon until it's been
mapped in the [`projects`](./config/workspace#projects) setting found in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](./config/workspace). When mapping a project, we require a unique identifier
for the project, and a project source location (path relative from the workspace root).

Let's say we have a frontend web application called "client", and a backend Node.js application
called "server", our `projects` setting would look like the following.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
	client: 'apps/client'
	server: 'apps/server'
```

> For easier maintenance, we suggest alpha sorting the `projects` map!

We can now run [`moon project client`](./commands/project) and
[`moon project server`](./commands/project) to display information about each project. If these
projects were not mapped, or were pointing to an invalid source, the command would throw an error.
