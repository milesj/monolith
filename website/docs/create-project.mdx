With a [workspace](./setup-workspace), we can now house one or many [projects](./concepts/project),
with a project being an application, library, or tool. In the end, each project will have its own
build layer, personal tasks, and custom configuration.

## Declaring a project in the workspace

Although a project may exist in your repository, it's not accessible from Moon until it's been
mapped in the [`projects`](./config/workspace#projects) setting found in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](./config/workspace). When mapping a project, we require a unique identifier
for the project, and a project source location (path relative from the workspace root).

Let's say we have a frontend web application called "client", and a backend Node.js application
called "server", our `projects` setting would look like the following.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
	client: 'apps/client'
	server: 'apps/server'
```

> For easier maintenance, we suggest alpha sorting the `projects` map!

We can now run [`moon project client`](./commands/project) and
[`moon project server`](./commands/project) to display information about each project. If these
projects were not mapped, or were pointing to an invalid source, the command would throw an error.

## Configuring a project

A project can be configured in 1 of 2 ways:

- Through the [`.moon/project.yml`](./config/global-project) config file, which defines file groups
  and tasks that are inherited by _all_ projects within the workspace. Perfect for standardizing
  common tasks like linting, type-checking, and code formatting.
- Through the [`project.yml`](./config/project) config file, found at the root of each project,
  which defines files groups, tasks, dependencies, and more that are unique to that project.

Both config files are optional, and can be used separately or together, the choice is yours!

Now let's continue with our client and server example above. If we wanted to configure both
projects, and defined config that's also share between the 2, we could do something like the
following:

<Tabs
  groupId="project-config"
  defaultValue="client"
  values={[
    { label: 'Client', value: 'client' },
    { label: 'Server', value: 'server' },
    { label: 'Both (inherited)', value: 'inherit' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="client">

```yaml title="apps/client/project.yml"
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'webpack'
		args:
			- 'build'
			- '--mode'
			- 'production'
			- '--entry'
			- 'src/index.tsx'
			- '--output-path'
			- 'build'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
		outputs:
			- 'build'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="server">

```yaml title="apps/server/project.yml"
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'babel'
		args:
			- 'src'
			- '--out-dir'
			- 'build'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
		outputs:
			- 'build'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="inherit">

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
tasks:
	format:
		command: 'prettier'
		args:
			- '--write'
			- '.'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
	lint:
		command: 'eslint'
		args:
			- '--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern'
			- '.'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
	test:
		command: 'jest'
		args:
			- '--passWithNoTests'
			- '.'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
			- 'tests/**/*'
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'
		args:
			- '--build'
		inputs:
			- 'src/**/*'
			- 'types/**/*'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adding optional metadata

When utilizing Moon in a large monorepo or organization, ownership becomes very important. To combat
this problem, Moon supports the [`project`](./config/project#project) field within a project's
[`project.yml`](./config/project) config.

This field is _optional_ by default, but when defined it provides metadata about the project,
specifically around team ownership, which developers maintain the project, where to discuss it, and
more!

```yaml title="project.yml"
project:
  type: 'tool'
  name: 'Moon'
  description: 'A monorepo management tool.'
  channel: '#moon'
  owner: 'infra.platform'
  maintainers: ['miles.johnson']
```
