The `.moon/workspace.yml` file configures projects and services in the workspace.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
$schema: 'https://moonrepo.dev/schemas/workspace.json'
```

## `extends`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#extends" />

Defines an external `.moon/workspace.yml` to extend and inherit settings from. Perfect for
reusability and sharing configuration across repositories and projects. When defined, this setting
must be an HTTPS URL _or_ relative file system path that points to a valid YAML document!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {1}
extends: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/organization/repository/master/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

:::caution

Settings will be merged recursively for blocks, with values defined in the local configuration
taking precedence over those defined in the extended configuration. However, the `projects` setting
_does not merge_!

:::

## `projects`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#projects" />

Defines the location of all [projects](../concepts/project) within the workspace. Supports either a
manual map of projects (default), a list of globs in which to automatically locate projects, _or_
both.

> Unlike packages in the JavaScript ecosystem, a moon project _does not_ require a `package.json`,
> and is not coupled to Yarn workspaces (or similar architectures).

### Using a map

When using a map, each project must be _manually_ configured and requires a unique
[name](../concepts/project#names) as the map key, where this name is used heavily on the command
line and within the project graph for uniquely identifying the project amongst all projects. The map
value (known as the project source) is a file system path to the project folder, relative from the
workspace root, and must be contained within the workspace boundary.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  admin: 'apps/admin'
  apiClients: 'packages/api-clients'
  designSystem: 'packages/design-system'
  web: 'apps/web'
```

### Using globs

If manually mapping projects is too tedious or cumbersome, you may provide a list of
[globs](../concepts/file-pattern#globs) to automatically locate all project folders, relative from
the workspace root.

When using this approach, the project name is derived from the project folder name, and is cleaned
to our [supported characters](../concepts/project#names) . Furthermore, globbing **does risk the
chance of collision**, and when that happens, we log a warning and skip the conflicting project from
being configured in the project graph.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

### Using a map _and_ globs<VersionLabel version="0.18" />

For those situations where you want to use _both_ patterns, you can! The list of globs can be
defined under a `globs` field, while the map of projects under a `sources` field.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  globs:
    - 'apps/*'
    - 'packages/*'
  sources:
    www: 'www'
```

## `generator`<VersionLabel version="0.14" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#generator" />

Configures aspects of the template generator.

### `templates`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/GeneratorConfig#templates" />

A list of file system paths where templates can be located, relative from the workspace root.
Defaults to `./templates`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
generator:
  templates:
    - './templates'
    - './other/templates'
```

## `hasher`<VersionLabel version="0.13" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#hasher" />

Configures aspects of smart hashing layer.

### `optimization`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/HasherConfig#optimization" />

Determines the optimization level to utilize when hashing content before running targets.

- `accuracy` (default) - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the resolved value in the
  lockfile. This requires parsing the lockfile, which may reduce performance.
- `performance` - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the value defined in the manifest. This
  is typically a version range or requirement.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
hasher:
  optimization: 'performance'
```

## `notifier`<VersionLabel version="0.17" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#notifier" />

Configures how moon notifies and interacts with a developer or an external system.

### `webhookUrl`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NotifierConfig#webhookUrl" />

Defines an HTTPS URL that all pipeline events will be posted to. View the
[webhooks guide for more information](../guides/webhooks) on available events.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
notifier:
  webhookUrl: 'https://api.company.com/some/endpoint'
```

## `runner`<VersionLabel updated version="0.13" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#runner" />

Configures aspects of the action runner.

### `cacheLifetime`<VersionLabel version="0.11" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#cacheLifetime" />

The maximum lifetime of cached artifacts before they're marked as stale and automatically removed by
the action runner. Defaults to "7 days". This field requires an integer and a timeframe unit that
can be [parsed as a duration](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  cacheLifetime: '24 hours'
```

### `cacheableTargets`<VersionLabel version="0.20" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#cacheableTargets" />

Defines a list of [targets](../concepts/target), with or without a project scope, that will be
cached within the runner. Tasks that produce [outputs](./project#outputs) are automatically cached,
and do not need to be defined here. Defaults to an empty list.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
runner:
  cacheableTargets:
    - ':test'
    - 'app:typecheck'
```

> This setting primarily exists for [remote caching](../guides/remote-cache) as it will create and
> persist tar archives located in `.moon/cache/outputs`.

### `implicitDeps`<VersionLabel version="0.16" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#implicitDeps" />

Defines task [`deps`](./project#deps) that are implicitly inherited by _all_ tasks within the
workspace. This is extremely useful for pre-building projects that are used extensively throughout
the repo, or always building project dependencies. Defaults to an empty list.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-5}
runner:
  implicitDeps:
    - '^:build'
```

### `implicitInputs`<VersionLabel version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#implicitInputs" />

Defines task [`inputs`](./project#inputs) that are implicitly inherited by _all_ tasks within the
workspace. This is extremely useful for the "changes to these files should always trigger a task"
scenario.

Like `inputs`, file paths/globs defined here are relative from the inheriting project.
[Project and workspace relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) are
supported and encouraged.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-5}
runner:
  implicitInputs:
    - 'package.json'
    - '/.moon/project.yml'
    - '/.moon/toolchain.yml'
    - '/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

> When not defined, this setting defaults to the list in the example above. When this setting _is
> defined_, that list will be overwritten, so be sure to explicitly define them if you would like to
> retain that functionality.

### `inheritColorsForPipedTasks`<VersionLabel version="0.3" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#inheritColorsForPipedTasks" />

Force colors to be inherited from the current terminal for all tasks that are ran as a child process
and their output is piped to the action runner. Defaults to `true`.
[View more about color handling in moon](../commands/overview#colors).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  inheritColorsForPipedTasks: true
```

### `logRunningCommand`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#logRunningCommand" />

When enabled, will log the task's command, resolved arguments, and working directory when a target
is ran. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  logRunningCommand: true
```

## `vcs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#vcs" />

Configures the version control system to utilize within the workspace (and repository). A VCS is
required for determining touched (added, modified, etc) files, calculating file hashes, computing
affected files, and much more.

### `defaultBranch`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/VcsConfig#defaultBranch" />

Defines the default branch in the repository for comparing differences against. For git, this is
typically "master" (default) or "main". For svn, this should always be "trunk".

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  defaultBranch: 'master'
```

### `manager`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/VcsConfig#manager" />

Defines the VCS tool/binary that is being used for managing the repository. Accepts "git" (default)
or "svn" (experimental, in development).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  manager: 'git'
```

### `remoteCandidates` <VersionLabel version="0.20" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/VcsConfig#remoteCandidates" />

(Git only) Defines a list of remote candidates to query agaist to determine merge bases. Defaults to
"origin" and "upstream".

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
vcs:
  remoteCandidates:
    - 'origin'
    - 'upstream'
```
