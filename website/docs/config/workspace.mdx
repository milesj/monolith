The `.moon/workspace.yml` file configures available projects and their locations, the toolchain, and
the workspace development environment.

## `extends`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

> `string`

Defines an external `.moon/workspace.yml` to extend and inherit settings from. Perfect for
reusability and sharing configuration across repositories and projects. When defined, this setting
must be an HTTPS URL _or_ relative file system path that points to a valid YAML document!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {1}
extends: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/organization/repository/master/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

:::caution

Settings will be merged recursively for blocks, with values defined in the local configuration
taking precedence over those defined in the extended configuration. However, the `projects` setting
_does not merge_!

:::

## `projects`<RequiredLabel />

> `Record<string, string> | string[]`

Defines the location of all [projects](../concepts/project) within the workspace. Supports either a
manual map of projects (default), _or_ a list of globs in which to automatically locate projects.

<Tabs
  groupId="projects-type"
  defaultValue="manual"
  values={[
    { label: 'Manual', value: 'manual' },
    { label: 'Automatic', value: 'auto' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="manual">

When using a map, each project must be _manually_ configured and requires a unique
[name](../concepts/project#names) as the map key, where this name is used heavily on the command
line and within the project graph for uniquely identifying the project amongst all projects. The map
value (known as the project source) is a file system path to the project folder, relative from the
workspace root, and must be contained within the workspace boundary.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  admin: 'apps/admin'
  apiClients: 'packages/api-clients'
  designSystem: 'packages/design-system'
  web: 'apps/web'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="auto">

If manually mapping projects is too tedious or cumbersome, you may provide a list of
[globs](../concepts/file-pattern#globs) to automatically locate all project folders, relative from
the workspace root.

When using this approach, the project name is derived from the project folder name, and is cleaned
to our [supported characters](../concepts/project#names) . Furthermore, globbing **does risk the
chance of collision**, and when that happens, we log a warning and skip the conflicting project from
being configured in the project graph.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Unlike packages in the JavaScript ecosystem, a moon project _does not_ require a `package.json`,
> and is not coupled to Yarn workspaces (or similar architectures).

## Languages

## `node`

> `NodeConfig`

Defines the Node.js version and package manager to install within the toolchain, as moon _does not_
use a Node.js binary found on the local machine. Managing the Node.js version within the toolchain
ensures a deterministic environment across any machine (whether a developer, CI, or production
machine).

> This setting is optional and will default Node.js to the latest
> [active LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) when not defined.

### `version`

> `string`

Defines the explicit Node.js version to use. We require an explicit and semantic major, minor, and
patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine. Ranges are _not_
supported.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  version: '16.13.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

### `packageManager`

> `npm | pnpm | yarn`

Defines which package manager to utilize within the workspace. Supports `npm` (default), `pnpm`, or
`yarn`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
```

### `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`

> `PackageManagerConfig`

Optional fields for defining package manager specific configuration. The chosen setting is dependent
on the value of [`node.packageManager`](#packagemanager). If these settings _are not defined_, the
latest version of the active package manager will be used (when applicable).

#### `version`

> `string`

The `version` setting defines the explicit package manager version to use. We require an explicit
major, minor, and patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {4}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
  yarn:
    version: '3.1.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NPM_VERSION`, `MOON_PNPM_VERSION`, or `MOON_YARN_VERSION`
> environment variables.

### `addEnginesConstraint`

> `boolean`

Injects the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) as an `engines` constraint to the root
`package.json` field. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml
node:
  addEnginesConstraint: true
```

For example, say our Node.js version is "16.15.0", and when we execute a run process through the
`moon` binary, it will update the root `package.json` with the below. We pin a fixed version to
ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing the same version.

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.15.0"
  }
}
```

### `aliasPackageNames`<VersionLabel version="0.10" />

> `NodeProjectAliasFormat`

When enabled, will assign [aliases](../concepts/project#aliases) to configured [projects](#projects)
based on the `name` field in the project's `package.json`. Aliases can be used as a substitute for
project names, allowing for the familiar package name to be used within
[targets](../concepts/target) or configuration.

This setting accepts one of the following values, which determines how to parse and assign the
alias.

- `name-and-scope` - Will use the package name as-is, including any scope. For example,
  `@scope/example` or `example`.
- `name-only` - Will only use the name and disregard any scope. For example, `@scope/example` will
  become `example`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  aliasPackageNames: 'name-only'
```

:::caution

This setting will eager load all `package.json`s within the repository, which may result in reduced
performance for a large amount of projects.

:::

### `dedupeOnLockfileChange`

> `boolean`

Will dedupe dependencies after they have been installed, added, removing, or changed in any way, in
an effort to keep the workspace tree as clean and lean as possible. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  dedupeOnLockfileChange: true
```

### `dependencyVersionFormat`<VersionLabel version="0.9" />

> `NodeVersionFormat`

When [syncing project dependencies](#syncprojectworkspacedependencies), customize the format that
will be used for the dependency version range. The following formats are supported (but use the one
most applicable to your chosen package manager):

- `file` - Uses `file:../relative/path` and copies package contents.
- `link` - Uses `link:../relative/path` and symlinks package contents.
- `star` - Uses an explicit `*`.
- `version` - Uses the explicit version from the dependent project's `package.json`, e.g., "1.2.3".
- `version-caret` - Uses the version from the dependent project's `package.json` as a caret range,
  e.g., "^1.2.3".
- `version-tilde` - Uses the version from the dependent project's `package.json` as a tilde range,
  e.g., "~1.2.3".
- `workspace` (default) - Uses `workspace:*`, which resolves to "1.2.3". Requires package
  workspaces.
- `workspace-caret` - Uses `workspace:^`, which resolves to "^1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.
- `workspace-tilde` - Uses `workspace:~`, which resolves to "~1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  dependencyVersionFormat: 'link'
```

> This setting does not apply to peer dependencies, as they will always use a format of
> `^<major>.0.0`.

### `inferTasksFromScripts`<VersionLabel version="0.8" />

> `boolean`

Will infer and automatically create [tasks](../concepts/task) from `package.json` scripts. Defaults
to `false`.

This requires the [project's language](./project#language) to be "javascript" or "typescript", a
`package.json` to exist in the project, and will take the following into account:

- Script names will be converted to kebab-case, and will become the task ID.
- Pre, post, and life cycle hooks are ignored.
- Tasks defined in `.moon/project.yml` or `moon.yml` take precedence over scripts of the same name.

To verify inferred tasks, run [`moon project <id>`](../commands/project) (pass `--json` to view raw
config and options). Tasks that are inferred will have their command and args set to
`moon node run-script`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  inferTasksFromScripts: true
```

:::caution

This implementation shares functionality with
[`moon migrate from-package-json`](../commands/migrate/from-package-json), and will attempt to
determine environment variables, outputs, CI options, and more! Be aware of these when utilizing
this feature, especially in regards to `runInCI`, as it may be inaccurate!

:::

### `syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies`

> `boolean`

Will sync a project's [`dependsOn`](./project#dependson) setting as normal dependencies within the
project's `package.json`. If a dependent project does not have a `package.json`, or if a dependency
of the same name has an explicit version already defined, the sync will be skipped. Defaults to
`true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `dependencies` within a project's `package.json`. The version format
can be customized with [`node.dependencyVersionFormat`](#dependencyversionformat).

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@company/design-system": "workspace:*",
    "@company/react-hooks": "workspace:*"
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `syncVersionManagerConfig`

> `(none) | nodenv | nvm`

Will sync the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) to a 3rd-party version manager's
config/rc file. Supports "nodenv" (syncs to `.node-version`), "nvm" (syncs to `.nvmrc`), or none
(default).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncVersionManagerConfig: 'nvm'
```

This is a special setting that ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing
the same version, which is a very common practice when managing dependencies.

## `typescript`<VersionLabel updated version="0.12" />

> `TypeScriptConfig`

Dictates how moon interacts with and utilizes TypeScript within the workspace. This field is
optional and is undefined by default. Define it to enable TypeScript support.

### `createMissingConfig`<VersionLabel version="0.6" />

> `boolean`

When [syncing project references](#syncprojectreferences) and a depended on project _does not_ have
a `tsconfig.json`, automatically create one. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  createMissingConfig: true
```

### `projectConfigFileName`

> `string`

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the project root. We utilize this setting when
syncing project references between projects. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  projectConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.build.json'
```

### `rootConfigFileName`

> `string`

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the workspace root. We utilize this setting
when syncing projects as references. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  rootConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.projects.json'
```

### `rootOptionsConfigFileName`<VersionLabel version="0.6" />

> `string`

Defines the file name of the config file found in the workspace root that houses shared compiler
options. Defaults to `tsconfig.options.json`. This setting is used in the following scenarios:

- When [creating a `tsconfig.json` for a project](#), sets the `extends` field to this value.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  rootOptionsConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.base.json'
```

### `syncProjectReferences`

> `boolean`

Will sync a project's [`dependsOn`](./project#dependson) setting as project references within that
project's `tsconfig.json`, and the workspace root `tsconfig.json`. Defaults to `true` when the
parent `typescript` setting is defined, otherwise `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  syncProjectReferences: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `references` within both `tsconfig.json`s.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "references": [
    // ...
    { "path": "../../design-system" },
    { "path": "../../react-hooks" }
  ]
}
```

## Features

## `actionRunner`

> `ActionRunnerConfig`

Configures aspects of the action runner.

### `cacheLifetime`<VersionLabel updated version="0.11" />

> `string`

The maximum lifetime of cached artifacts before they're marked as stale and automatically removed by
the action runner. Defaults to "7 days". This field requires an integer and a timeframe unit that
can be [parsed as a duration](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
actionRunner:
  cacheLifetime: '24 hours'
```

### `implicitInputs`<VersionLabel updated version="0.9" />

> `string[]`

Defines task [`inputs`](./project#inputs) that are implicit inherited by _all_ tasks within the
workspace. This is extremely useful for the "changes to these files should always trigger a task"
scenario.

Like `inputs`, file paths/globs defined here are relative from the inheriting project.
[Project and workspace relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) are
supported and encouraged.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-5}
actionRunner:
  implicitInputs:
    - 'package.json'
    - '/.moon/project.yml'
    - '/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

> When not defined, this setting defaults to the list in the example above. When this setting _is
> defined_, that list will be overwritten, so be sure to explicitly define them if you would like to
> retain that functionality.

### `inheritColorsForPipedTasks`<VersionLabel version="0.3" />

> `boolean`

Force colors to be inherited from the current terminal for all tasks that are ran as a child process
and their output is piped to the action runner. Defaults to `true`.
[View more about color handling in moon](../commands/overview#colors).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
actionRunner:
  inheritColorsForPipedTasks: true
```

### `logRunningCommand`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

> `boolean`

When enabled, will log the task's command, resolved arguments, and working directory when a target
is ran. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
actionRunner:
  logRunningCommand: true
```

## `hasher`<VersionLabel version="0.13" />

> `HasherConfig`

Configures aspects of smart hashing layer.

### `optimization`<VersionLabel version="0.13" />

Determines the optimization level to utilize when hashing content before running targets.

- `accuracy` (default) - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the resolved value in the
  lockfile. This requires communicating with the package manager, which may reduce performance.
- `speed` - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the value defined in the manifest.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
hasher:
  optimization: 'speed'
```

## `vcs`

> `VcsConfig`

Configures the version control system to utilize within the workspace (and repository). A VCS is
required for determining touched (added, modified, etc) files, calculating file hashes, computing
affected files, and much more.

### `manager`

> `git | svn`

Defines the VCS tool/binary that is being used for managing the repository. Accepts "git" (default)
or "svn" (experimental).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  manager: 'git'
```

### `defaultBranch`

Defines the default upstream branch (master/main/trunk) in the repository for comparing differences
against. For git, this is typically "master" (default) or "main", and must include the remote prefix
(before /). For svn, this should always be "trunk".

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  defaultBranch: 'master'
```
