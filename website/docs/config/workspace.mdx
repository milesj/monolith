The `.moon/workspace.yml` file configures available projects and their locations, the toolchain, and
the workspace development environment.

## `projects`<RequiredLabel />

> `Record<string, string>`

Defines the location of all [projects](../concepts/project) within the workspace. Each project
requires a unique ID as the map key, where this ID is used heavily on the command line and within
the project graph for uniquely identifying the project amongst all projects. The map value (known as
the project source) is a file system path to the project folder, relative from the workspace root,
and must be contained within the workspace boundary.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  admin: 'apps/admin'
  apiClients: 'packages/api-clients'
  designSystem: 'packages/design-system'
  web: 'apps/web'
```

Unlike packages in the JavaScript ecosystem, a Moon project _does not_ require a `package.json`, and
is not coupled to Yarn workspaces (or similar architectures).

> **Why doesn't Moon auto-detect projects?** Moon _does not_ automatically detect projects using
> file system globs for the following reasons:
>
> - Depth-first scans are expensive, especially when the workspace continues to grow.
> - CI and other machines may inadvertently detect more projects because of left over artifacts.
> - Centralizing a manifest of projects allows for an easy review and approval process.

## `node`

> `NodeConfig`

Defines the Node.js version and package manager to install within the toolchain, as Moon _does not_
use a Node.js binary found on the local machine. Managing the Node.js version within the toolchain
ensures a deterministic environment across any machine (whether a developer, CI, or production
machine).

> This setting is optional and will default Node.js to the latest
> [active LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) when not defined.

### `version`

> `string`

Defines the explicit Node.js version to use. We require an explicit and semantic major, minor, and
patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine. Ranges are _not_
supported.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  version: '16.13.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

### `packageManager`

> `npm | pnpm | yarn`

Defines which package manager to utilize within the workspace. Supports `npm` (default), `pnpm`, or
`yarn`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
```

### `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`

> `PackageManagerConfig`

Optional fields for defining package manager specific configuration. The chosen setting is dependent
on the value of [`node.packageManager`](#packagemanager). If these settings _are not defined_, the
latest version of the active package manager will be used (when applicable).

#### `version`

> `string`

The `version` setting defines the explicit package manager version to use. We require an explicit
major, minor, and patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {4}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
  yarn:
    version: '3.1.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NPM_VERSION`, `MOON_PNPM_VERSION`, or `MOON_YARN_VERSION`
> environment variables.

### `addEnginesConstraint`

> `boolean`

Injects the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) as an `engines` constraint to the root
`package.json` field. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml
node:
  addEnginesConstraint: true
```

For example, say our Node.js version is "16.14.0", and when we execute a run process through the
`moon` binary, it will update the root `package.json` with the below. We pin a fixed version to
ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing the same version.

```json title="package.json"
{
	// ...
	"engines": {
		"node": "16.14.0"
	}
}
```

### `dedupeOnLockfileChange`

> `boolean`

Will dedupe dependencies after they have been installed, added, removing, or changed in any way, in
an effort to keep the workspace tree as clean and lean as possible. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  dedupeOnLockfileChange: true
```

### `syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies`

> `boolean`

Will sync a project's [`dependsOn`](./project#dependson) setting as normal dependencies within the
project's `package.json`, using `workspace:*` or `*` version ranges (depending on what the package
manager supports). If a dependent project does not have a `package.json`, or if a dependency of the
same name has an explicit version already defined, the sync will be skipped. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml title="project.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `dependencies` within a project's `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
	// ...
	"dependencies": {
		"@company/design-system": "workspace:*",
		"@company/react-hooks": "workspace:*"
		// ...
	}
}
```

### `syncVersionManagerConfig`

> `(none) | nodeenv | nvm`

Will sync the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) to a 3rd-party version manager's
config/rc file. Supports "nodeenv" (syncs to `.node-version`), "nvm" (syncs to `.nvmrc`), or none
(default).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncVersionManagerConfig: 'nvm'
```

This is a special setting that ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing
the same version, which is a very common practice when managing dependencies.

## `typescript`

> `TypeScriptConfig`

Dictates how Moon interacts with and utilizes TypeScript within the workspace.

### `projectConfigFileName`

> `string`

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the project root. We utilize this setting when
syncing project references between projects. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  projectConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.build.json'
```

### `rootConfigFileName`

> `string`

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the workspace root. We utilize this setting
when syncing projects as references. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  rootConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.projects.json'
```

### `syncProjectReferences`

> `boolean`

Will sync a project's [`dependsOn`](./project#dependson) setting as project references within that
project's `tsconfig.json`, and the workspace root `tsconfig.json`. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  syncProjectReferences: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `references` within both `tsconfig.json`s.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
	// ...
	"references": [
		// ...
		{ "path": "../../design-system" },
		{ "path": "../../react-hooks" }
	]
}
```

## `vcs`

> `VcsConfig`

Configures the version control system to utilize within the workspace (and repository). A VCS is
required for determining touched (added, modified, etc) files, calculating file hashes, computing
affected files, and much more.

### `manager`

> `git | svn`

Defines the VCS tool/binary that is being used for managing the repository. Accepts "git" (default)
or "svn" (experimental).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  manager: 'git'
```

### `defaultBranch`

Defines the default upstream branch (master/main/trunk) in the repository for comparing differences
against. For git, this is typically "origin/master" (default) or "origin/main", and must include the
remote prefix (before /). For svn, this should always be "trunk".

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  defaultBranch: 'origin/master'
```
