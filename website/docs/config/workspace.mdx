The `.moon/workspace.yml` file configures available projects and their locations, the toolchain, and
the workspace development environment.

## `extends`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#extends" />

Defines an external `.moon/workspace.yml` to extend and inherit settings from. Perfect for
reusability and sharing configuration across repositories and projects. When defined, this setting
must be an HTTPS URL _or_ relative file system path that points to a valid YAML document!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {1}
extends: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/organization/repository/master/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

:::caution

Settings will be merged recursively for blocks, with values defined in the local configuration
taking precedence over those defined in the extended configuration. However, the `projects` setting
_does not merge_!

:::

## `projects`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#projects" />

Defines the location of all [projects](../concepts/project) within the workspace. Supports either a
manual map of projects (default), _or_ a list of globs in which to automatically locate projects.

<Tabs
  groupId="projects-type"
  defaultValue="manual"
  values={[
    { label: 'Manual', value: 'manual' },
    { label: 'Automatic', value: 'auto' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="manual">

When using a map, each project must be _manually_ configured and requires a unique
[name](../concepts/project#names) as the map key, where this name is used heavily on the command
line and within the project graph for uniquely identifying the project amongst all projects. The map
value (known as the project source) is a file system path to the project folder, relative from the
workspace root, and must be contained within the workspace boundary.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  admin: 'apps/admin'
  apiClients: 'packages/api-clients'
  designSystem: 'packages/design-system'
  web: 'apps/web'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="auto">

If manually mapping projects is too tedious or cumbersome, you may provide a list of
[globs](../concepts/file-pattern#globs) to automatically locate all project folders, relative from
the workspace root.

When using this approach, the project name is derived from the project folder name, and is cleaned
to our [supported characters](../concepts/project#names) . Furthermore, globbing **does risk the
chance of collision**, and when that happens, we log a warning and skip the conflicting project from
being configured in the project graph.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
projects:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Unlike packages in the JavaScript ecosystem, a moon project _does not_ require a `package.json`,
> and is not coupled to Yarn workspaces (or similar architectures).

## Languages

## `node`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#node" />

Defines the Node.js version and package manager to install within the toolchain, as moon _does not_
use a Node.js binary found on the local machine. Managing the Node.js version within the toolchain
ensures a deterministic environment across any machine (whether a developer, CI, or production
machine).

### `version`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#version" />

Defines the explicit Node.js version to use. We require an explicit and semantic major, minor, and
patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine. Ranges are _not_
supported.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  version: '16.13.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

### `packageManager`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#packageManager" />

Defines which package manager to utilize within the workspace. Supports `npm` (default), `pnpm`, or
`yarn`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
```

### `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodePackageManagerConfig" />

Optional fields for defining package manager specific configuration. The chosen setting is dependent
on the value of [`node.packageManager`](#packagemanager). If these settings _are not defined_, the
latest version of the active package manager will be used (when applicable).

#### `version`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodePackageManagerConfig#version" />

The `version` setting defines the explicit package manager version to use. We require an explicit
major, minor, and patch version, to ensure the same environment is used across every machine.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {4}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
  yarn:
    version: '3.1.0'
```

> Version can be overridden with the `MOON_NPM_VERSION`, `MOON_PNPM_VERSION`, or `MOON_YARN_VERSION`
> environment variables.

### `yarn`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#yarn" />

#### `plugins`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/YarnConfig#plugins" />

A list of plugins that will automatically be imported using `yarn plugin import` (Yarn 2+ only). For
performance reasons, plugins will only be imported when the Yarn version changes.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {4}
node:
  packageManager: 'yarn'
  yarn:
    version: '3.1.0'
    plugins:
      - 'interactive-tools'
      - 'workspace-tools'
```

### `addEnginesConstraint`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#addEnginesConstraint" />

Injects the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) as an `engines` constraint to the root
`package.json` field. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml
node:
  addEnginesConstraint: true
```

For example, say our Node.js version is "16.15.0", and when we execute a run process through the
`moon` binary, it will update the root `package.json` with the below. We pin a fixed version to
ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing the same version.

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.15.0"
  }
}
```

### `aliasPackageNames`<VersionLabel version="0.10" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#aliasPackageNames" />

When enabled, will assign [aliases](../concepts/project#aliases) to configured [projects](#projects)
based on the `name` field in the project's `package.json`. Aliases can be used as a substitute for
project names, allowing for the familiar package name to be used within
[targets](../concepts/target) or configuration.

This setting accepts one of the following values, which determines how to parse and assign the
alias.

- `name-and-scope` - Will use the package name as-is, including any scope. For example,
  `@scope/example` or `example`.
- `name-only` - Will only use the name and disregard any scope. For example, `@scope/example` will
  become `example`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  aliasPackageNames: 'name-only'
```

### `dedupeOnLockfileChange`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#dedupeOnLockfileChange" />

Will dedupe dependencies after they have been installed, added, removing, or changed in any way, in
an effort to keep the workspace tree as clean and lean as possible. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  dedupeOnLockfileChange: true
```

### `dependencyVersionFormat`<VersionLabel version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#dependencyVersionFormat" />

When [syncing project dependencies](#syncprojectworkspacedependencies), customize the format that
will be used for the dependency version range. The following formats are supported (but use the one
most applicable to your chosen package manager):

- `file` - Uses `file:../relative/path` and copies package contents.
- `link` - Uses `link:../relative/path` and symlinks package contents.
- `star` - Uses an explicit `*`.
- `version` - Uses the explicit version from the dependent project's `package.json`, e.g., "1.2.3".
- `version-caret` - Uses the version from the dependent project's `package.json` as a caret range,
  e.g., "^1.2.3".
- `version-tilde` - Uses the version from the dependent project's `package.json` as a tilde range,
  e.g., "~1.2.3".
- `workspace` (default) - Uses `workspace:*`, which resolves to "1.2.3". Requires package
  workspaces.
- `workspace-caret` - Uses `workspace:^`, which resolves to "^1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.
- `workspace-tilde` - Uses `workspace:~`, which resolves to "~1.2.3". Requires package workspaces.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  dependencyVersionFormat: 'link'
```

> This setting does not apply to peer dependencies, as they will always use a format of
> `^<major>.0.0`.

### `inferTasksFromScripts`<VersionLabel version="0.8" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#inferTasksFromScripts" />

Will infer and automatically create [tasks](../concepts/task) from `package.json` scripts. Defaults
to `false`.

This requires the [project's language](./project#language) to be "javascript" or "typescript", a
`package.json` to exist in the project, and will take the following into account:

- Script names will be converted to kebab-case, and will become the task ID.
- Pre, post, and life cycle hooks are ignored.
- Tasks defined in `.moon/project.yml` or `moon.yml` take precedence over scripts of the same name.

To verify inferred tasks, run [`moon project <id>`](../commands/project) (pass `--json` to view raw
config and options). Tasks that are inferred will have their command and args set to
`moon node run-script`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  inferTasksFromScripts: true
```

:::caution

This implementation shares functionality with
[`moon migrate from-package-json`](../commands/migrate/from-package-json), and will attempt to
determine environment variables, outputs, CI options, and more! Be aware of these when utilizing
this feature, especially in regards to `runInCI`, as it may be inaccurate!

:::

### `syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies" />

Will sync a project's [`dependsOn`](./project#dependson) setting as normal dependencies within the
project's `package.json`. If a dependent project does not have a `package.json`, or if a dependency
of the same name has an explicit version already defined, the sync will be skipped. Defaults to
`true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncProjectWorkspaceDependencies: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `dependencies` within a project's `package.json`. The version format
can be customized with [`node.dependencyVersionFormat`](#dependencyversionformat).

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@company/design-system": "workspace:*",
    "@company/react-hooks": "workspace:*"
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `syncVersionManagerConfig`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/NodeConfig#syncVersionManagerConfig" />

Will sync the currently configured [Node.js version](#version) to a 3rd-party version manager's
config/rc file. Supports "nodenv" (syncs to `.node-version`), "nvm" (syncs to `.nvmrc`), or none
(default).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
node:
  syncVersionManagerConfig: 'nvm'
```

This is a special setting that ensure other Node.js processes outside of our toolchain are utilizing
the same version, which is a very common practice when managing dependencies.

## `typescript`<VersionLabel updated version="0.12" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#typescript" />

Dictates how moon interacts with and utilizes TypeScript within the workspace. This field is
optional and is undefined by default. Define it to enable TypeScript support.

### `createMissingConfig`<VersionLabel version="0.6" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#createMissingConfig" />

When [syncing project references](#syncprojectreferences) and a depended on project _does not_ have
a `tsconfig.json`, automatically create one. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  createMissingConfig: true
```

### `projectConfigFileName`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#projectConfigFileName" />

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the project root. We utilize this setting when
syncing project references between projects. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  projectConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.build.json'
```

### `rootConfigFileName`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#rootConfigFileName" />

Defines the file name of the `tsconfig.json` found in the workspace root. We utilize this setting
when syncing projects as references. Defaults to `tsconfig.json`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  rootConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.projects.json'
```

### `rootOptionsConfigFileName`<VersionLabel version="0.6" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#rootOptionsConfigFileName" />

Defines the file name of the config file found in the workspace root that houses shared compiler
options. Defaults to `tsconfig.options.json`. This setting is used in the following scenarios:

- When [creating a `tsconfig.json` for a project](#), sets the `extends` field to this value.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  rootOptionsConfigFileName: 'tsconfig.base.json'
```

### `routeOutDirToCache`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#routeOutDirToCache" />

Updates the `outDir` compiler option in each project's [`tsconfig.json`](#projectConfigFileName) to
route to moon's cache folder. This is useful when using project references and wanting to keep all
the compiled `.d.ts` files _out_ of the project folder. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  routeOutDirToCache: true
```

As a demonstration, if we had an npm package located at "packages/components", the `outDir` compiler
option will be re-routed to the following when syncing.

```json title="<project>/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "outDir": "../../.moon/cache/types/packages/components"
  }
}
```

### `syncProjectReferences`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#syncProjectReferences" />

Will sync a project's [dependencies](../concepts/project#dependencies) (when applicable) as project
references within that project's `tsconfig.json`, and the workspace root `tsconfig.json`. Defaults
to `true` when the parent `typescript` setting is defined, otherwise `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  syncProjectReferences: true
```

A quick example on how this works. Given the following `dependsOn`:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'designSystem'
  - 'reactHooks'
```

Would result in the following `references` within both `tsconfig.json`s.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "references": [
    // ...
    { "path": "../../design-system" },
    { "path": "../../react-hooks" }
  ]
}
```

### `syncProjectReferencesToPaths`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TypeScriptConfig#syncProjectReferencesToPaths" />

Will sync a project's [`tsconfig.json`](#projectConfigFileName) project references to the `paths`
compiler option, using the referenced project's `package.json` name. This is useful for mapping
import aliases to their source code. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
typescript:
  syncProjectReferencesToPaths: true
```

As a demonstration, if we had a reference to a shared npm package with the name `@brand/components`,
the `paths` compiler option would be updated to the following when syncing. The index file may exist
in a `src` folder, or the root of the package.

```json title="<project>/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "@brand/components": ["../shared/components/src/index.ts"],
      "@brand/components/*": ["../shared/components/src/*"]
    }
  },
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "../shared/components"
    }
  ]
}
```

> This setting runs _after_ [`syncProjectReferences`](#syncprojectreferences) and will inherit any
> synced references from that setting.

## Features

## `generator`<VersionLabel version="0.14" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#generator" />

Configures aspects of the template generator.

### `templates`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/GeneratorConfig#templates" />

A list of file system paths where templates can be located, relative from the workspace root.
Defaults to `./templates`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-4}
generator:
  templates:
    - './templates'
    - './other/templates'
```

## `hasher`<VersionLabel version="0.13" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#hasher" />

Configures aspects of smart hashing layer.

### `optimization`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/HasherConfig#optimization" />

Determines the optimization level to utilize when hashing content before running targets.

- `accuracy` (default) - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the resolved value in the
  lockfile. This requires parsing the lockfile, which may reduce performance.
- `performance` - When hashing dependency versions, utilize the value defined in the manifest. This
  is typically a version range or requirement.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
hasher:
  optimization: 'performance'
```

## `runner`<VersionLabel updated version="0.13" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#runner" />

Configures aspects of the action runner.

### `cacheLifetime`<VersionLabel version="0.11" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#cacheLifetime" />

The maximum lifetime of cached artifacts before they're marked as stale and automatically removed by
the action runner. Defaults to "7 days". This field requires an integer and a timeframe unit that
can be [parsed as a duration](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  cacheLifetime: '24 hours'
```

### `implicitDeps`<VersionLabel version="0.16" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#implicitDeps" />

Defines task [`deps`](./project#deps) that are implicit inherited by _all_ tasks within the
workspace. This is extremely useful for pre-building projects that are used extensively throughout
the repo, or always building dependencies. Defaults to an empty list.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-5}
runner:
  implicitDeps:
    - '^:build'
```

### `implicitInputs`<VersionLabel version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#implicitInputs" />

Defines task [`inputs`](./project#inputs) that are implicit inherited by _all_ tasks within the
workspace. This is extremely useful for the "changes to these files should always trigger a task"
scenario.

Like `inputs`, file paths/globs defined here are relative from the inheriting project.
[Project and workspace relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) are
supported and encouraged.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2-5}
runner:
  implicitInputs:
    - 'package.json'
    - '/.moon/project.yml'
    - '/.moon/workspace.yml'
```

> When not defined, this setting defaults to the list in the example above. When this setting _is
> defined_, that list will be overwritten, so be sure to explicitly define them if you would like to
> retain that functionality.

### `inheritColorsForPipedTasks`<VersionLabel version="0.3" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#inheritColorsForPipedTasks" />

Force colors to be inherited from the current terminal for all tasks that are ran as a child process
and their output is piped to the action runner. Defaults to `true`.
[View more about color handling in moon](../commands/overview#colors).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  inheritColorsForPipedTasks: true
```

### `logRunningCommand`<VersionLabel version="0.4" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/RunnerConfig#logRunningCommand" />

When enabled, will log the task's command, resolved arguments, and working directory when a target
is ran. Defaults to `false`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
runner:
  logRunningCommand: true
```

## `vcs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/WorkspaceConfig#vcs" />

Configures the version control system to utilize within the workspace (and repository). A VCS is
required for determining touched (added, modified, etc) files, calculating file hashes, computing
affected files, and much more.

### `manager`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/VcsConfig#manager" />

Defines the VCS tool/binary that is being used for managing the repository. Accepts "git" (default)
or "svn" (experimental).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  manager: 'git'
```

### `defaultBranch`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/VcsConfig#defaultBranch" />

Defines the default upstream branch (master/main/trunk) in the repository for comparing differences
against. For git, this is typically "master" (default) or "main", and must include the remote prefix
(before /). For svn, this should always be "trunk".

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml" {2}
vcs:
  defaultBranch: 'master'
```
