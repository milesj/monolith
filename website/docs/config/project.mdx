import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

The `moon.yml` configuration file _is not required_ but can be used to define additional metadata
for a project, override inherited tasks, and more at the project-level. When used, this file must
exist in a project's root, as configured in [`projects`](./workspace#projects).

## `dependsOn`<VersionLabel updated version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#dependsOn" />

Explicitly defines _other_ projects that _this_ project depends on, primarily when generating the
project and task graphs. The most common use case for this is building those projects _before_
building this one, and for syncing [`package.json`](./workspace#syncprojectworkspacedependencies)
dependencies and [`tsconfig.json`](./workspace#syncprojectreferences) project references when
applicable.

When defined, this setting requires an array of project names, which are the keys found in the
[`projects`](./workspace#projects) map.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'apiClients'
  - 'designSystem'
```

A dependency object can also be defined, where a specific `scope` can be assigned, which accepts
"production" (default), "development", or "peer". This maps to the appropriate field in
`package.json` when syncing.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
  - id: 'apiClients'
    scope: 'production'
  - id: 'designSystem'
    scope: 'peer'
```

## Metadata

## `language`<VersionLabel version="0.3" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#language" />

The primary programming language the project is written in. Supports the following values:

- `bash` - A [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) based project (Unix only).
  <VersionLabel version="0.6" />
- `batch` - A [Batch](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting) based project (Windows
  only). <VersionLabel version="0.9" />
- `javascript` - A [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) based
  project. Inferred when `package.json` exists.
- `typescript` - A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based project. Inferred when
  `tsconfig.json` exists.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured or inferred.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
language: 'javascript'
```

> For convenience, when this setting is not defined, moon will attempt to detect the language based
> on configuration files found in the project root.

## `project`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#project" />

The `project` setting defines metadata about the project itself. Although this setting is optional,
when defined, all fields within it _must_ be defined as well.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
project:
  name: 'moon'
  description: 'A monorepo management tool.'
  channel: '#moon'
  owner: 'infra.platform'
  maintainers: ['miles.johnson']
```

The information listed within `project` is purely informational and primarily displayed within the
CLI. However, this setting exists for you, your team, and your company, as a means to identify and
organize all projects. Feel free to build your own tooling around these settings!

### `channel`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#channel" />

The Slack, Discord, Teams, IRC, etc channel name (with leading #) in which to discuss the project.

### `description`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#description" />

A description of what the project does and aims to achieve. Be as descriptive as possible, as this
is the kind of information search engines would index on.

### `maintainers`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#maintainers" />

A list of people/developers that maintain the project, review code changes, and can provide support.
Can be a name, email, LDAP name, GitHub username, etc, the choice is yours.

### `name`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#name" />

A human readable name of the project. This is _different_ from the unique project name configured in
[`projects`](./workspace#projects).

### `owner`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#owner" />

The team or organization that owns the project. Can be a title, LDAP name, GitHub team, etc. We
suggest _not_ listing people/developers as the owner, use [maintainers](#maintainers) instead.

## `type`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectMetadataConfig#type" />

The type of project. Supports the following values:

- `application` - A backend or frontend application that communicates over HTTP, TCP, RPC, etc.
- `library` - A self-contained, shareable, and publishable set of code.
- `tool` - An internal tool, command line program, one-off script, etc.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
type: 'application'
```

## Tasks

## `fileGroups`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#fileGroups" />

Defines [file groups](../concepts/file-group) to be used by local tasks. By default, this setting
_is not required_ for the following reasons:

- File groups are an optional feature, and are designed for advanced use cases.
- File groups defined in [`.moon/project.yml`](./global-project) will be inherited by all projects.

When defined this setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a
list of [globs or paths](../concepts/file-pattern). Globs and paths are
[relative to a project](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) (even when defined
[globally](./global-project)).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
fileGroups:
  configs:
    - '*.config.{js,cjs,mjs}'
    - '*.json'
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
```

> The code snippet above is merely an example of file groups. Feel free to use those groups as-is,
> modify the glob lists, add and remove groups, or implement completely new groups. The choice is
> yours!

## `tasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#tasks" />

Tasks are actions that are ran within the context of a [project](../concepts/project), and commonly
wrap an npm binary or system command. This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name
for the task, and the value is an object of task parameters.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
  test:
    command: 'jest'
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
```

### `command`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#command" />

The `command` field is the command line to run for the task, including the command name (must be
first) and any optional [arguments](#args). This field is required when _not_ inheriting a global
task of the same name.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {3}
tasks:
  format:
    # Using a string
    command: 'prettier --check .'
    # Using an array
    command:
      - 'prettier'
      - '--check'
      - '.'
```

By default a task assumes the command name is an npm binary, and if you'd like to reference a system
command, you'll also need to set the [`platform`](#platform) to "system". We do our best to
automatically detect this, but it's not accurate in all scenarios.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./dist'
    platform: 'system'
```

#### Special commands

For interoperability reasons, the following command names have special handling.

- `noop`, `no-op`, `nop` - Marks the task as a "no operation". Will not execute a command in the
  action runner but can define dependencies.
- When `platform` is "node":
  - `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.
- When `platform` is "system":
  - `cmd`, `cmd.exe` - Will execute the arguments with `cmd.exe` (Windows only).
  - `powershell`, `powershell.exe` - Will execute the arguments with `powershell.exe` (Windows
    only).

### `args`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#args" />

The `args` field is a collection of _additional_ arguments to pass to the command line when
executing the task. This field exists purely to provide arguments for
[inherited tasks](./global-project#tasks).

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    # Using a string
    args: '--color --maxWorkers 3'
    # Using an array
    args:
      - '--color'
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
```

However, for the array approach to work correctly, each argument _must_ be its own distinct item,
including argument values. For example:

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      # Valid
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
      # Also valid
      - '--maxWorkers=3'
      # Invalid
      - '--maxWorkers 3'
```

### `deps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#deps" />

The `deps` field is a list of other tasks (known as [targets](../concepts/target)), either within
this project or found in another project, that will be executed _before_ this task. It achieves this
by generating a directed task graph based on the project graph.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'apiClients:build'
      - 'designSystem:build'
      # A task within the current project
      - 'codegen'
```

### `env`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#env" />

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables when running the command.
Variables defined here will take precedence over those loaded with [`envFile`](#envfile).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    env:
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

### `inputs`<VersionLabel updated version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#inputs" />

The `inputs` field is a list of sources that calculate whether to execute this task based on the
environment and files that have been touched since the last time the task has been ran. If _not_
defined, then all files within a project are considered an input (`**/*`).

Inputs support the following source types:

- Environment variables (must start with a `$`). <VersionLabel version="0.9" />
- [Project and workspace relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative)

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-10}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    inputs:
      # Config files anywhere within the project
      - '**/.eslintignore'
      - '**/.eslintrc.js'
      # Config files at the workspace root
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      # Environment variables
      - '$ESLINT_CACHE'
```

:::caution

When using an environment variable, we assume _it's not defined_ by default, and will trigger an
affected state when it _is_ defined. If the environment variable always exists, then the task will
always run and bypass the cache.

:::

### `local`<VersionLabel version="0.11" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#local" />

Marks the task as local only. This should primarily be enabled for long-running or never-ending
tasks, like development servers and watch mode. Defaults to `true` if the task name is "dev",
"start", or "serve", and `false` otherwise.

This is a convenience setting for local development that sets the following task options:

- [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off
- [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"
- [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Turned off

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'webpack server'
    local: true
```

### `outputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#outputs" />

The `outputs` field is a list of files and folders that are _created_ as a result of executing this
task, excluding internal cache files that are created from the underlying command (for example,
`.eslintcache`).

Outputs are necessary for [incremental caching and rehydration](../concepts/cache). If you'd prefer
to avoid that functionality, omit this field.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    outputs:
      # Relative from project root
      - 'build/'
```

> Outputs require [project relative file patterns](../concepts/file-pattern#project-relative).

### `options`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#options" />

The `options` field is an object of configurable options that can be used to modify the task and its
execution. The following fields can be provided, with merge related fields supporting all
[merge strategies](../concepts/task#merge-strategies).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6-8}
tasks:
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc --noEmit'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'replace'
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `cache`<VersionLabel version="0.9" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#cache" />

Whether to cache the task's execution result using our [smart hashing](../concepts/cache#hashing)
system. If disabled, _will not_ create a cache hash, and _will not_ persist a task's
[outputs](#outputs). Defaults to `true`.

We suggest disabling caching when defining cleanup tasks, one-off scripts, or file system heavy
operations.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6}
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./temp'
    options:
      cache: false
```

#### `envFile`<VersionLabel version="0.11" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#envFile" />

A boolean or path to a project relative file (also know as dotenv file) that defines a collection of
[environment variables](#env) for the current task. Variables will be loaded on project creation,
but will _not_ override those defined in [`env`](#env).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    options:
      # Defaults to .env
      envFile: true
      # Or
      envFile: '.env.production'
```

#### `mergeArgs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeArgs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task#merge-strategies) to use when merging the [`args`](#args) list with
an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeDeps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeDeps" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task#merge-strategies) to use when merging the [`deps`](#deps) list with
an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeEnv`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeEnv" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task#merge-strategies) to use when merging the [`env`](#env) map with an
inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeInputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeInputs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task#merge-strategies) to use when merging the [`inputs`](#inputs) list
with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeOutputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#mergeOutputs" />

The [strategy](../concepts/task#merge-strategies) to use when merging the [`outputs`](#outputs) list
with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `outputStyle`<VersionLabel version="0.10" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#outputStyle" />

Controls how stdout/stderr is displayed when the task is ran as a _transitive target_. By default,
this setting is not defined and defers to the action runner, but can be overridden with one of the
following values:

- `buffer` - Buffers output and displays after the task has exited (either success or failure).
- `buffer-only-failure` - Like `buffer`, but only displays on failures.
  <VersionLabel version="0.11" />
- `hash` - Ignores output and only displays the generated [hash](../concepts/cache#hashing).
  <VersionLabel version="0.11" />
- `none` - Ignores output. <VersionLabel version="0.11" />
- `stream` - Streams output directly to the terminal. Will prefix each line of output with the
  target.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
```

#### `retryCount`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#retryCount" />

The number of attempts the task will retry execution before returning a failure. This is especially
useful for flaky tasks. Defaults to `0`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      retryCount: 3
```

#### `runDepsInParallel`<VersionLabel version="0.10" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runDepsInParallel" />

Whether to run the task's [`deps`](#deps) in parallel or serial (in order). Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {8}
tasks:
  start:
    # ...
    deps:
      - '~:clean'
      - '~:build'
    options:
      runDepsInParallel: false
```

#### `runInCI`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runInCI" />

Whether to run the task automatically in a CI (continuous integration) environment when affected by
touched files, typically through the [`moon ci`](../commands/ci) command. Defaults to `true` unless
the [`local`](#local) setting is disabled, but is _always_ true when a task defines
[`outputs`](#outputs).

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      runInCI: false
```

#### `runFromWorkspaceRoot`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskOptionsConfig#runFromWorkspaceRoot" />

Whether to use the workspace root as the working directory when executing a task. Defaults to
`false` and runs from the task's project root.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {5}
tasks:
  typecheck:
    # ...
    options:
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

### `platform`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/TaskConfig#platform" />

The `platform` field defines the platform the command runs on, where to locate its executable, and
which tool to execute it with. By default moon will set to a value based on the project's
[`language`](#language).

- `node` - Command is a binary within node modules and will be executed with Node.js.
- `system` - Command is expected to exist within the system's environment.
- `unknown` - When not inferred.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4}
tasks:
  env:
    command: 'printenv'
    platform: 'system'
```

> This field exists because of our [toolchain](../concepts/toolchain), and moon ensuring the correct
> command is ran.

## Workspace overrides

Dictates how a project interacts with settings defined at the workspace-level.

## `workspace`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectConfig#workspace" />

### `inheritedTasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectWorkspaceConfig#inheritedTasks" />

Provides a layer of control when inheriting tasks from [`.moon/project.yml`](./global-project).

#### `exclude`

The optional `exclude` setting permits a project to exclude specific tasks from being inherited. It
accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global task to exclude.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Exclude the inherited `test` task for this project
    exclude: ['test']
```

> Exclusion is applied after inclusion and before renaming.

#### `include`

The optional `include` setting permits a project to _only_ include specific inherited tasks (works
like an allow/white list). It accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global
task to include.

When this field is not defined, the project will inherit all tasks from the global project config.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,7-9}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Include *no* tasks (works like a full exclude)
    include: []

    # Only include the `lint` and `test` tasks for this project
    include:
      - 'lint'
      - 'test'
```

> Inclusion is applied before exclusion and renaming.

#### `rename`

The optional `rename` setting permits a project to rename the inherited task within the current
project. It accepts a map of strings, where the key is the original name (found in the global
project config), and the value is the new name to use.

For example, say we have 2 tasks in the global project config called `buildPackage` and
`buildApplication`, but we only need 1, and since we're an application, we should omit and rename.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {4,5}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    exclude: ['buildPackage']
    rename:
      buildApplication: 'build'
```

> Renaming occurs after inclusion and exclusion.

### `node`<VersionLabel version="0.16" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectWorkspaceConfig#node" />

Configures Node.js for this project and overrides the workspace-level [`node`](./workspace#node)
setting. Currently, only the Node.js version can be overridden per-project, not the package manager.

#### `version`

Defines the explicit Node.js version to use when _running tasks_ for this project.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2}
workspace:
  node:
    version: '12.12.0'
```

### `typescript`<VersionLabel version="0.12" />

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types/interface/ProjectWorkspaceConfig#typescript" />

Enables or disables [TypeScript support](./workspace#typescript) for this project. Currently
controls project reference syncing and `tsconfig.json` creation. Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title="moon.yml" {2}
workspace:
  typescript: false
```
