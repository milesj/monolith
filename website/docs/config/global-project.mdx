The `.moon/project.yml` file configures file groups and tasks that are inherited by _every_ project
in the workspace. Projects can override or merge with these settings within their respective
[`project.yml`](./project).

## `fileGroups`

> `Record<string, string[]>`

> For more information on file group configuration, refer to the
> [`fileGroups`](./project#filegroups) section in the [`project.yml`](./project) doc.

Defines [file groups](../concepts/file-group) that will be inherited by all projects, and also
enables enforcement of organizational patterns and file locations. For example, encourage all
projects to place source files in a `src` folder, and all test files in `tests`.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
fileGroups:
  configs:
    - '*.{js,json}'
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*.test.*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
    - '**/*'
```

> Relative file paths and globs used within a file group are relative from the inherited project's
> root, and not the workspace.

## `tasks`

> `Record<string, TaskConfig>`

> For more information on task configuration, refer to the [`tasks`](./project#tasks) section in the
> [`project.yml`](./project) doc.

As mentioned in the link above, [tasks](../concepts/task) are actions that are ran within the
context of a project, and commonly wrap an npm binary or system command. For most workspaces, every
project _should_ have linting, type-checking, testing, code formatting, so on and so forth. To
reduce the amount of boilerplate that _every_ project would require, this setting offers the ability
to define tasks that are inherited by all projects within the workspace, but can also be overridden
per project.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
    args: '--check .'

  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    args: '--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern .'

  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args: '--passWithNoTests .'

  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
    args: '--build'
```

> Relative file paths and globs used within a task are relative from the inherited project's root,
> and not the workspace.
