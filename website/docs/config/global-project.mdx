title: .moon/project.yml

The `.moon/project.yml` file configures file groups and tasks that are inherited by _every_ project
in the workspace. Projects can override these settings within their respective
[`project.yml`](./project).

## `fileGroups`

> For more information on file group configuration, refer to the
> [`fileGroups`](./project#filegroups) section in the [`project.yml`](./project) doc.

Globs and paths are relative to a project (even when defined globally TODO LINK).

## `tasks`

> For more information on task configuration, refer to the [`tasks`](./project#tasks) section in the
> [`project.yml`](./project) doc.

As mentioned in the link above, [tasks](../concepts/task) are actions that are ran within the
context of a project, and commonly wrap an npm or shell command. For most workspaces, every project
_should_ have linting, type-checking, testing, code formatting, so on and so forth. To reduce the
amount of boilerplate that _every_ project would require, we offer the ability to define tasks that
are inherited by all projects within the workspace, but can also be overridden per project.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
    args:
      - '--check'
      - '.'

  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    args:
      - '--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern'
      - '.'

  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      - '--passWithNoTests'
      - '.'

  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
    args:
      - '--build'
```
