One of moon's most powerful features is the [toolchain](./concepts/toolchain), which manages and
automatically installs Node.js and other tools. The toolchain is configured with
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](./config/toolchain).

:::info

This toolchain article is currently Node.js only. If you're using another language, feel free to
skip to the next article, [creating a project](./create-project).

## Choosing a package manager

Before we continue, we should briefly talk about Node.js package managers. To start, moon does not
replace a package manager, nor does it apply any "magic" for them to work differently. Instead, moon
builds upon a package manager to provide a robust build system, assumes a standard `node_modules`
layout and module resolution algorithm, and supports any of the following 3 package managers.

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1, v2+ in `node-modules` linker mode)

### Enabling workspaces (optional)

moon was built with monorepos in mind, and as such, has first-class support for them through package
workspaces (but is not a requirement). To utilize workspaces, enable them for your chosen package
manager.

import PackageWorkspaces from './__partials__/node/package-workspaces.mdx';

<PackageWorkspaces />

## Configuring Node.js

As Node.js is the backbone of a JavaScript based repository, let's define the version we want to
install in the toolchain, to enforce for developers, and to utilize when running `moon` commands, by
updating [`node.version`](./config/toolchain#version) in
[`.moon/toolchain.yml`](./config/toolchain).

This setting requires an explicit semantic version and _does not_ support version ranges, so let's
set it to the latest version. We suggest _always_ using an
[Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
```

Let's now run [`moon setup --log debug`](./commands/setup) to verify that Node.js is downloaded and
installed correctly. Pretty cool right?

:::info

The Node.js version can also be customized _per project_ using the
[`toolchain.node.version`](./config/project#node) setting in [`moon.yml`](./config/project). This
setting exists to support legacy projects that are coupled to an old version and are unable to
upgrade. We suggest keeping all projects on the same version whenever possible.

:::

## Configuring a package manager

Even though Node.js is now installed, we need a package manager to install dependencies. Earlier we
talked about [choosing a package manager](./install#choosing-a-package-manager), so let's use that
choice here by defining [`node.packageManager`](./config/toolchain#packagemanager).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
	packageManager: 'yarn'
```

By default moon will install a stable version of the package manager, but this isn't consistently
updated, so we suggest defining an explicit semantic version for the package manager as well,
through the [`node.<packageManager>.version`](./config/toolchain#version-1) setting.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
	packageManager: 'yarn'
	yarn:
		version: '3.2.0'
```

Once again, let's run [`moon setup --log debug`](./commands/setup) to verify the package manager is
installed, and also take note that Node.js is _already_ installed. Based on the example
configuration above, we'll be switching from npm (the default) to yarn.

## Adding a package script

For scenarios like CI, `moon` can be ran with through a root `package.json` script — but this comes
with a cost — which is the overhead of launching Node.js and your chosen package manager to execute
the Rust binary, _instead of_ executing the Rust binary directly. If this is problematic, feel free
to use the global binary.

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "moon": "moon",
    // For Yarn 2+
    "moon": "$(yarn bin moon)"
  }
}
```

:::caution

Yarn 2+ does not support executing Rust binaries through package scripts
([issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/882)), so we must access the full binary path and
execute on that.

:::

With this script, moon can then be run with `npm run moon ...` (or `yarn run`, or `pnpm run`).
