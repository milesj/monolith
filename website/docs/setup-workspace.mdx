Once moon has been initialized, we must setup the [workspace](./concepts/workspace), which is
denoted by the `.moon` folder â€” this is known as the workspace root. The workspace is in charge of:

- Integrating with a version control system.
- Defining configuration that applies to its entire tree.
- Housing [projects](./concepts/project) to build a project graph.
- Managing a [toolchain](./concepts/toolchain) that automatically installs Node.js and other tools.
- Running tasks and the build system.

## Configuring Node.js

The most important tool within moon and its toolchain is Node.js, as it's the backbone of a
JavaScript based repository. Let's now define the Node.js version we want to install in the
toolchain, enforce for developers, and to utilize when running `moon` commands, by updating
[`node.version`](./config/toolchain#version) in [`.moon/toolchain.yml`](./config/toolchain).

This setting requires an explicit semantic version and _does not_ support version ranges, so let's
set it to the latest version. We suggest _always_ using an
[Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
```

Let's now run [`moon --log debug setup`](./commands/setup) to verify that Node.js is downloaded and
installed correctly. Pretty cool right?

The Node.js version can also be customized _per project_ using the
[`toolchain.node.version`](./config/project#node) setting in [`moon.yml`](./config/project). This
setting exists to support legacy projects that are coupled to an old version and are unable to
upgrade. We suggest keeping all projects on the same version whenever possible.

## Configuring a package manager

Even though Node.js is now installed, we need a package manager to install dependencies. During
installation, we talked about [choosing a package manager](./install#choosing-a-package-manager), so
let's use that choice here by defining [`node.packageManager`](./config/toolchain#packagemanager).

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
	packageManager: 'yarn'
```

By default moon will install the latest version of a package manager, but this isn't consistently
updated, so we suggest defining an explicit semantic version for the package manager as well,
through the [`node.<packageManager>.version`](./config/toolchain#version-1) setting.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
node:
	version: '18.0.0'
	packageManager: 'yarn'
	yarn:
		version: '3.2.0'
```

Once again, let's run [`moon --log debug setup`](./commands/setup) to verify the package manager is
installed, and also take note that Node.js is _already_ installed. Based on the example
configuration above, we'll be switching from npm (the default) to yarn.

## Configuring a version control system

> moon defaults to `git` for a VCS, so feel free to skip this if you use git.

moon requires a version control system (VCS) to be present for functionality like file diffing,
hashing, and revision comparison. The VCS and its default branch can be configured through the
[`vcs`](./config/workspace#vcs) setting.

<Tabs
  groupId="vcs"
  defaultValue="git"
  values={[
    { label: 'git', value: 'git' },
    { label: 'svn', value: 'svn' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="git">

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
vcs:
	manager: 'git'
	defaultBranch: 'master'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="svn">

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
vcs:
	manager: 'svn'
	defaultBranch: 'trunk'
```

> SVN support is experimental and may not work properly!

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
