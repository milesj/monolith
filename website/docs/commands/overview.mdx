title: Overview

The following options are available for _all_ moon commands.

- `--cache <mode>` - The mode for [cache operations](#caching).
- `--help` - Display the help menu for the current command.
- `--log <level>` - The lowest [log level to output](#logging).
- `--version` - Display the version of the CLI.

Global options _must_ be passed after the `moon` before and before the command.

```shell
$ moon --log error <command>
```

## Caching

- `off` - Turn off caching entirely. Every task will run fresh.
- `read` - Read existing items from the cache, but do not write to them.
- `write` (default) - Read and write items to the cache.
