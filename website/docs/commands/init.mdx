title: init
---

The `moon init [dest]` command will initialize moon into a repository and scaffold config files by
creating a `.moon` folder. By default, moon will automatically infer the Node.js version, package
manager, and potential projects based on existing files.

```shell
$ moon init

# In another directory
$ moon init ./app
```

### Arguments

- `[dest]` - Destination to initialize and scaffold into. Defaults to `.` (current working
  directory).

### Options

- `--force` - Overwrite existing config files if they exist.
- `--inheritProjects <as>` - Sets the default value on whether to inherit projects from
  `package.json` workspaces. Supports:
  - `none` - Do not inherit projects.
  - `globs-list` - Inherit globs as-is and configure as a list.
  - `projects-map` - Glob the file system for projects and configure as a map.
- `--packageManager <type>` - Sets the default value for which package manager to use, if none were
  detected.
  - Types: `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`
- `--yes` - Skip all prompts and use default values.
