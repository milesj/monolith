title: init
---

The `moon init [dest]` command will initialize moon into a repository and scaffold config files by
creating a `.moon` folder. By default moon will enable the following supported languages when a
certain file exists, or we'll prompt you to decide.

- `node` enabled when `package.json` exists.
- `rust` enabled when `Cargo.toml` exists.
- `typescript` enabled when `tsconfig.json` exists.

Furthermore, we'll also attempt to detect applicable language versions, dependency managers, and
other ecosystem related settings.

```shell
$ moon init

# In another directory
$ moon init ./app
```

The command can also be used to initialize a specific tool _after_ moon has already been
initialized. Perfect for adopting a new language into the workspace.

```shell
$ moon init --tool typescript
```

### Arguments

- `[dest]` - Destination to initialize and scaffold into. Defaults to `.` (current working
  directory).

### Options

- `--force` - Overwrite existing config files if they exist.
- `--minimal` - Generate minimal configurations and sane defaults.
- `--tool` - Individual tool to initialize and configure.
  - Accepts: `node`, `rust`, `typescript`
- `--yes` - Skip all prompts and enables tools based on file detection.
