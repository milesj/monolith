title: init
---

The `moon init [dest]` command will initialize moon into a repository and scaffold config files by
creating a `.moon` folder. By default, moon will automatically infer the Node.js version, package
manager, and potential projects based on existing files.

```shell
$ moon init

# In another directory
$ moon init ./app
```

The command can also be used to initialize a specific tool _after_ moon has already been
initialized. Perfect for adopting a new language into the workspace.

```shell
$ moon init --tool typescript
```

### Arguments

- `[dest]` - Destination to initialize and scaffold into. Defaults to `.` (current working
  directory).

### Options

- `--force` - Overwrite existing config files if they exist.
- `--tool` - Individual tool to initialize and configure.
  - Accepts: `node`, `typescript`
- `--yes` - Skip all prompts and use default values.
