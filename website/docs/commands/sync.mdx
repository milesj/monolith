title: sync
---

The `moon sync` command will force sync _all_ projects in the workspace. What is syncing exactly? To
ensure a [healthy repository state](../faq#what-should-be-considered-the-source-of-truth), we
trigger a process known as syncing, where a project is automatically updated to:

- Ensure cross-project dependencies are linked based on [`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependsOn).
- Ensure language specific configuration files are present and accurate (`package.json`,
  `tsconfig.json`, etc).
- Ensure root configuration and project configuration are in sync.
- Any additional language specific semantics that may be required.

```shell
$ moon sync
```

> This command should rarely be ran, as [`moon run`](./run) will sync affected projects
> automatically! However, when migrating or refactoring, manual syncing may be necessary.
