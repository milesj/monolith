title: run
---

The `run` command will run a [target](../concepts/target) (a task within a project) and all of it's
dependencies in topological order. Each run will incrementally cache each task, improving speed and
development times... over time.

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint

# Run `lint` in all projects
$ moon run :lint
```

### Arguments

- `<target>` - [Target](../concepts/target) to run.
- `[-- <args>]` - Additional arguments to
  [pass to the underlying command](../run-task#passing-arguments-to-the-underlying-command).

### Options

- `--dependents` - Run downstream dependent targets (of the same task ID) as well.
- `--profile <type>` - Record and [generate a profile](../guides/profile) for ran tasks.
  - Types: `cpu`, `heap`

#### Affected

- `--affected` - Only run target if affected by changed files, _otherwise_ will always run.
- `--status <type>` - Filter affected based on a change status.
  - Types: `all` (default), `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`
- `--upstream` - Determine affected against upstream by comparing `HEAD` against a base revision
  (default branch), _otherwise_ uses local changes.
