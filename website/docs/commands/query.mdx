The `query` command can be used to query information about moon, its projects, their tasks, the
environment, the pipeline, and many other aspects of the workspace.

Querying is divided into multiple sub-commands, each serving a specific purpose. Each sub-command
will return JSON, allowing for easy parsing and readability.

This command is a work in progress, and will continue to evolve over time!

## Projects

Use the `query projects` sub-command to query about all projects in the project graph. The project
list can be filtered by passing [options](#options).

```shell
# Find all projects
$ moon query projects

# Find all projects with an id that matches "react"
$ moon query projects --id react

# Find all projects with a `lint` or `build` task
$ moon query projects --tasks 'lint|build'
```

This will return a list of project objects with the following structure:

```ts
{
	projects: Project[],
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Options

All values are case-insensitive regex patterns.

- `--id <regex>` - Filter projects that match this ID.
- `--language <regex>` - Filter projects of this programming language.
- `--source <regex>` - Filter projects that match this source path.
- `--tasks <regex>` - Filter projects that have the following tasks.
- `--type <regex>` - Filter project of this type.

## Touched files

Use the `query touched-files` sub-command to query for a list of touched files (added, modified,
deleted, etc) using the current VCS state. These are the same queries that [`moon ci`](./ci) and
[`moon run`](./run) use under the hood.

Touches files are determined using the following logic:

- If `--defaultBranch` is provided, and the current branch is the
  [`vcs.defaultBranch`](../config/workspace#defaultbranch), then compare against the previous
  revision of the default branch (`HEAD~1`). This is what [continuous integration](../guides/ci)
  uses.
- If `--local` is provided, touched files are based on your local index only (`git status`).
- Otherwise, then compare the defined base (`--base`) against head (`--head`).

```shell
# Return all files
$ moon query touched-files

# Return deleted files
$ moon query touched-files --status deleted

# Return all files between 2 revisions
$ moon query touched-files --base <branch> --head <commit>
```

This will return a list of absolute file paths with the following stsructure:

```ts
{
	files: string[],
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Options

- `--defaultBranch` - When on the default branch, compare against the previous revision.
- `--base <rev>` - Base branch, commit, or revision to compare against. Defaults to
  [`vcs.defaultBranch`](../config/workspace#defaultbranch).
- `--head <rev>` - Current branch, commit, or revision to compare with. Defaults to `HEAD`.
- `--local` - Gather files from you local state instead of upstream.
- `--status <type>` - Filter files based on a touched status.
  - Types: `all` (default), `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`
