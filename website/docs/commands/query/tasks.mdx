import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

Use the `moon query tasks` sub-command to query task information for all projects in the project
graph. The tasks list can be filtered by passing a [query statement](../../concepts/query-lang) as
an argument, or by using [options](#options) arguments.

```shell
# Find all tasks grouped by project
$ moon query tasks

# Find all tasks from projects with an id that matches "react"
$ moon query tasks --id react
$ moon query tasks "task~react"
```

By default, this will output a list of projects, and tasks within the project being indented (with a
tab) on their own line.

```
web
	:lint | eslint
	:test | jest
app
	:format | prettier
```

The tasks can also be output in JSON ([which contains all data](/api/types/interface/Task)) by
passing the `--json` flag. The output has the following structure:

```ts
{
	tasks: Record<string, Record<string, Task>>,
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Arguments

- `[query]` - An optional [query statement](../../concepts/query-lang) to filter projects with. When
  provided, all [filter options](#filters) are ignored. <VersionLabel version="1.4.0" />

### Options

- `--affected` - Filter projects that have been affected by touched files. This will only filter
  based on files, and _does not_ include upstream or downstream dependencies.
- `--json` - Display the projects in JSON format.

#### Filters

All option values are case-insensitive regex patterns.

- `--alias <regex>` - Filter projects that match this alias.
- `--id <regex>` - Filter projects that match this ID/name.
- `--language <regex>` - Filter projects of this programming language.
- `--source <regex>` - Filter projects that match this source path.
- `--tasks <regex>` - Filter projects that have the following tasks.
- `--type <regex>` - Filter project of this type.

### Configuration

- [`projects`](../../config/workspace#projects) in `.moon/workspace.yml`
- [`tasks`](../../config/project#tasks) in `moon.yml`
