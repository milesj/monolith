Use the `moon query tasks` sub-command to query task information for all projects in the project
graph. The tasks list can be filtered by passing [options](#options).

```shell
# Find all tasks grouped by project
$ moon query tasks

# Find all tasks for projects with an id that matches "react"
$ moon query tasks --id react
```

By default, this will output a list of projects, and tasks within the project being indented (with a
tab) on their own line.

```
web
	:lint | eslint
	:test | jest
app
	:format | prettier
```

The tasks can also be output in JSON ([which contains all data](/api/types/interface/Task)) by
passing the `--json` flag. The output has the following structure:

```ts
{
	tasks: Record<string, Record<string, Task>>,
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Options

All values are case-insensitive regex patterns.

- `--alias <regex>` - Filter projects that match this alias.
- `--affected` - Filter projects that have been affected by touched files.
- `--id <regex>` - Filter projects that match this ID/name.
- `--json` - Display the projects in JSON format.
- `--language <regex>` - Filter projects of this programming language.
- `--source <regex>` - Filter projects that match this source path.
- `--tasks <regex>` - Filter projects that have the following tasks.
