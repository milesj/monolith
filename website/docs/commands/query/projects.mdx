Use the `query projects` sub-command to query information about all projects in the project graph.
The project list can be filtered by passing [options](#options).

```shell
# Find all projects
$ moon query projects

# Find all projects with an id that matches "react"
$ moon query projects --id react

# Find all projects with a `lint` or `build` task
$ moon query projects --tasks 'lint|build'
```

This will return a list of project objects with the following structure:

```ts
{
	projects: Project[],
	options: QueryOptions,
}
```

### Options

All values are case-insensitive regex patterns.

- `--id <regex>` - Filter projects that match this ID.
- `--language <regex>` - Filter projects of this programming language.
- `--source <regex>` - Filter projects that match this source path.
- `--tasks <regex>` - Filter projects that have the following tasks.
- `--type <regex>` - Filter project of this type.
