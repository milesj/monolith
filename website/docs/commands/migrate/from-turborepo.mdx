Use the `moon migrate from-turborepo` command to migrate a Turborepo powered repository to moon.
This process will convert the root `turbo.json` file to moon applicable configuration files:

- Migrates `pipeline` global tasks to [`.moon/tasks.yml`](../../config/tasks#tasks) and project
  scoped tasks to [`moon.yml`](../../config/project#tasks).
- Migrates `globalDependencies` and `globalEnv` to
  [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../../config/workspace#implicitinputs) (via `runner.implicitInputs`).

```shell
$ moon migrate from-turborepo
```

:::caution

moon must be [initialized](../init) and [`node`](../../config/toolchain#node) must be configured in
the toolchain before this command is ran! We also suggest enabling the
[`node.aliasPackageNames`](../../config/toolchain#aliaspackagenames) setting to ensure projects are
resolved correctly.

Furthermore, this process does not change existing `package.json` scripts, so if you're looking to
migrate them as well, use the [`moon migrate from-package-json`](./from-package-json) command.

:::

## Caveats

- This process _will not_ migrate root-level Turborepo tasks (those starting with `//#`). You'll
  need to manually create a moon [root-level project](../../guides/root-project) and migrate tasks.
