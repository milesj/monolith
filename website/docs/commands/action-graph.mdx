title: action-graph
---

The `moon action-graph [target]` (or `moon ag`) command will generate and serve a visual graph of
all actions and tasks within the workspace, known as the
[action graph](../how-it-works/action-graph). In other tools, this is sometimes referred to as a
dependency graph or task graph.

```shell
# Run the visualizer locally
$ moon action-graph

# Export to DOT format
$ moon action-graph --dot > graph.dot
```

> A target can be passed to focus the graph, including dependencies _and_ dependents. For example,
> `moon action-graph app:build`.

### Arguments

- `[target]` - Optional target to focus.

### Options

- `--dot` - Output the graph in DOT format.

## Example output

The following output is an example of the graph in DOT format.

```dot
digraph {
    0 [ label="SetupNodeTool" style=filled, shape=oval, fillcolor=black, fontcolor=white]
    1 [ label="InstallNodeDeps" style=filled, shape=oval, fillcolor=gray, fontcolor=black]
    2 [ label="SyncNodeProject(node)" style=filled, shape=oval, fillcolor=gray, fontcolor=black]
    3 [ label="RunTask(node:standard)" style=filled, shape=oval, fillcolor=gray, fontcolor=black]
    1 -> 0 [ arrowhead=box, arrowtail=box]
    2 -> 0 [ arrowhead=box, arrowtail=box]
    3 -> 1 [ arrowhead=box, arrowtail=box]
    3 -> 2 [ arrowhead=box, arrowtail=box]
}
```
