The `moon ci` command is a special command that should be ran in a continuous integration (CI)
environment, as it does all the heavy lifting necessary for effectively running tasks.

By default this will run all tasks that are affected by touched files and have the
[`runInCI`](../config/project#runinci) task option enabled.

```shell
$ moon ci
```

However, you can provide a list of targets to run, instead of relying on `runInCI`.

```shell
$ moon ci :build :lint
```

> View the official [continuous integration guide](../guides/ci) for a more in-depth example of how
> to utilize this command.

### Arguments

- `...[target]` - [Targets](../concepts/target) to run.

### Options

- `--base <rev>` - Base branch, commit, or revision to compare against. Can be set with `MOON_BASE`.
  Defaults to [`vcs.defaultBranch`](../config/workspace#defaultbranch).
- `--head <rev>` - Current branch, commit, or revision to compare with. Can be set with `MOON_HEAD`.
  Defaults to `HEAD`.
- `--job <index>` - Index of the current job.
- `--jobTotal <total>` Total amount of jobs to run.
