title: setup

The `setup` command can be used to setup the developer and pipeline environments. It achieves this
by downloading and installing all configured tools into the toolchain.

```shell
$ moon setup
```

> This command should rarely be used, as the environment is automatically setup when running other
> commands, like detecting affected projects, running a task, or generating a build artifact.
