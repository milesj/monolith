The `moon docker prune` command will reduce the overall filesize of the Docker environment by:

- Installing production only dependencies for projects that were scaffolded.
- Removing extraneous dependencies (`node_modules`, etc) for unfocused projects.

```shell
$ moon docker prune
```

:::caution

This command _must be_ ran after [`moon docker scaffold`](./scaffold) and is typically ran within a
`Dockerfile`!
