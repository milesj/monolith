The `moon docker prune` command will reduce the overall filesize of the Docker environment by
installing production only dependencies for projects that were scaffolded, and removing any
applicable extraneous files.

```shell
$ moon docker prune
```

:::caution

This command _must be_ ran after [`moon docker scaffold`](./scaffold) and is typically ran within a
`Dockerfile`!
