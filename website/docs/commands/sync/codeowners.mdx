The `moon sync codeowners` command will manually sync code owners, by aggregating all owners from
projects, and generating a single `CODEOWNERS` file. Refer to the official
[code owners](../../guides/codeowners) guide for more information.

```shell
$ moon sync codeowners
```

### Options

- `--clean` - Clean and remove previously generated file.
- `--force` - Bypass cache and force create file.
