The `moon sync hooks` command will manually sync hooks for the configured
[VCS](../../config/workspace#vcs), by generating and referencing hook scripts from the
[`vcs.hooks`](../../config/workspace#hooks) setting. Refer to the official
[VCS hooks](../../guides/vcs-hooks) guide for more information.

```shell
$ moon sync hooks
```
