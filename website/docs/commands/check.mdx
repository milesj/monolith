title: check
---

The `moon check [...projects]` (or `moon c`) command will run all build tasks (has
[`outputs`](../config/project#outputs)) and test tasks (has [`runInCI`](../config/project#runinci)
enabled) for one or many projects in parallel. This is a convenience command for checking all
applicable tasks for a project at once, instead of running multiple [`moon run`](./run) commands.

```shell
# Check project at current working directory
$ moon check

# Check project by name
$ moon check app

# Check multiple projects by name
$ moon check client server
```

### Arguments

- `[...names]` - List of project names or aliases to explicitly check, as defined in
  [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects).
