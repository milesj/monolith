<VersionLabel header version="0.13" />

The `moon check [...projects]` (or `moon c`) command will run _all_
[build and test tasks](../concepts/task#types) for one or many projects. This is a convenience
command for verifying the current state of a project, instead of running multiple
[`moon run`](./run) commands.

```shell
# Check project at current working directory
$ moon check

# Check project by name
$ moon check app

# Check multiple projects by name
$ moon check client server
```

### Arguments

- `[...names]` - List of project names or aliases to explicitly check, as defined in
  [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects).
