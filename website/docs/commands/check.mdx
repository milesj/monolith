title: check
---

The `moon check [...projects]` (or `moon c`) command will run _all_
[build and test tasks](../concepts/task#types) for one or many projects. This is a convenience
command for verifying the current state of a project, instead of running multiple
[`moon run`](./run) commands.

```shell
# Check project at current working directory
$ moon check

# Check project by name
$ moon check app

# Check multiple projects by name
$ moon check client server

# Check ALL projects (may be costly)
$ moon check --all
```

### Arguments

- `[...names]` - List of project names or aliases to explicitly check, as defined in
  [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects).

### Options

- `--all` - Run check for all projects in the workspace.
- `-u`, `--updateCache` - Bypass cache and force update any existing items.
