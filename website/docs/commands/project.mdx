The `moon project <name>` (or `moon p`) command will display all available information about a
project that has been configured and exists within the graph. If a project does not exist, the
program will return with a 1 exit code.

```shell
$ moon project web
```

### Arguments

- `<name>` - Name or alias of a project, as defined in [`projects`](../config/workspace#projects).

### Options

- `--json` - Print the project and its configuration as JSON.
