title: Install Moon
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The following guide can be used for adding Moon to an existing repository (with incremental
adoption), or to a fresh repository. All that's required is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=
12.17.0 and a `package.json` at the root.

## Choosing a package manager

Before we install Moon, we should briefly talk about Node.js package managers. To start, Moon does
not replace a package manager, nor does it apply any "magic" for them to work differently. Instead,
Moon builds upon a package manager to provide a robust build system, assumes a standard
`node_modules` layout and module resolution algorithm, and supports any of the following 3 package
managers.

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1, v2/3 in `node-modules` linker mode)

We suggest Yarn 3 for its powerful workspaces implementation, extensive support for native binaries,
built-in package patching, and blazing speed, but feel free to choose the one that works best for
you!

### Enabling workspaces

Moon was built with monorepos in mind, and as such, has first-class support for them through package
workspaces (but is not a requirement). To utilize workspaces, enable them for your chosen package
manager.

## Installing the CLI

The entirety of Moon is packaged and shipped as a single binary through the `@moonrepo/cli` npm
package. Begin by installing this package at the root of the repository.

  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'Yarn (classic)', value: 'yarn1' },

    { label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm' },

```

### Accessing the `moon` binary

We suggest _not_ installing the package globally, as adding an explicit development dependency with
a version range ensures all developers and machines are using the same version of Moon. With that
being said, how should you access `moon`? If you'd like it to be accessible in a global-like
fashion, we suggest one of the following patterns:

1. Update your `PATH` environment variable to include a path to the installed node module. This
   would need to be added to every developers shell and other environments, like CI.

```bash title="~/.bashrc"
export PATH="/path/to/repo/node_modules/@moonrepo/cli:$PATH"
```

```shell
moon --help
```

2. Symlink the binary to the root of the repository. This would require every developer to run the
   binary from the repository root, which isn't the worst, but would work for other environments.
   This can be automated through a `postinstall` script.

```shell
ln -s ./node_modules/@moonrepo/cli/moon ./moon
```

```shell
./moon --help
```

3. Add the binary as a `package.json` script. Jump to the next section for more information.

```shell
yarn run moon --help
```

### Adding a package script

Another way to utilize the `moon` binary would be through a `package.json` script -- but this comes
with a cost -- which is the overhead of launching Node.js and your chosen package manager to execute
the Rust binary, _instead of_ executing the Rust binary directly.

```json title="package.json"
{
	// ...
	"scripts": {
		// ...
		"moon": "moon",
		// For Yarn 2+
		"moon": "$(yarn bin moon)"
	}
}
```

> Yarn 2+ does not support executing Rust binaries through package scripts
> ([issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/882)), so we must access the full binary path and
> execute on that.

With this script, Moon can then be run with `npm run moon ...` (or `yarn run`, or `pnpm run`), but
do note that this pattern _will not_ work with package workspaces unless the script is ran from the
repository root.

### Supported targets

Because Moon is written in Rust, we only support targets that are explicitly compiled for, which
are:

- MacOS Intel (x64)
- Linux (x86_64, gnu)
- Windows (x64)

## Initializing Moon

Now that we have the CLI installed, let's scaffold and initialize Moon in a repository with the
[`moon init`](./commands/init) command. Be sure to [access the binary](#accessing-the-moon-binary)
as mentioned above.

```shell
$ moon init
```

When executed, the following operations will be applied.

- Creates a `.moon` folder with associated [`.moon/workspace.yml`](./config/workspace) and
  [`.moon/project.yml`](./config/global-project) configuration files.
- Append necessary ignore patterns to the relative `.gitignore`.
