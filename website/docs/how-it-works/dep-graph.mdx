title: Dependency graph

import DepGraph from '@site/src/components/Docs/DepGraph';

When you run a [task](../config/project#tasks-1) on the command line, we generate a dependency graph
to ensure [dependencies](../config/project#deps) of tasks have ran before running run the primary
task.

The dependency graph is a representation of all [tasks](../concepts/task), derived from the
[project graph](./project-graph), and is also represented internally as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG).

## Actions

Unlike other task runners in the industry that represent each node in the graph as a task to run, we
represent each node in the graph as an action to perform. This allows us to be more flexible and
efficient with how we run tasks, and allows us to provide more functionality and automation than
other runners.

The following actions compose our dependency graph:

### Setup toolchain

The most important action in the graph is the setup toolchain action, which downloads and installs a
tier 3 language into the toolchain. For other tiers, this is basically a no-operation.

- When the tool has already been installed, this action will be skipped.
- Actions will be scoped by language and version, also known as a runtime. For example,
  `SetupNodeTool(18.1.0)` or `SetupDenoTool(1.31.0)`.
- Tools that require a global language binary will display the version as "global". For example,
  `SetupNodeTool(global)`.

### Install dependencies

Before we run a target, we ensure that all language dependencies (`node_modules` for example) have
been installed, by automatically installing them if we detect changes since the last run. We achieve
this by comparing lockfile modified timestamps, parsing manifest files, and hashing resolved
dependency versions.

- When dependencies do _not_ need to be installed, this action will be skipped.
- Depending on the language and configuration, we may install dependencies in a project
  (`InstallDepsInProject`), or in the workspace root for all projects (`InstallDeps`).
- Actions will be scoped by language and version, also known as a runtime. For example,
  `InstallNodeDeps(18.1.0)` or `InstallNodeDepsInProject(18.1.0, example)`.

> This action depends on the setup toolchain action, because we utilize the binaries in the
> toolchain to install dependencies.

### Sync project

To ensure a consistently healthy project and repository, we run a process known as syncing
_everytime_ a target is ran. Actions will be scoped by language, for example,
`SyncNodeProject(example)`.

What is synced or considered healthcare is dependent on the language and its ecosystem.

- JavaScript
  - Syncs `package.json` dependencies based on [project graph](./project-graph) dependencies.
  - Applies [`deno`](../config/toolchain#deno) and [`node`](../config/toolchain#node) related
    settings.
- TypeScript
  - Syncs project references based on [project graph](./project-graph) dependencies.
  - Applies [`typescript`](../config/toolchain#typescript) related settings.

> This action depends on the setup toolchain action, in case it requires binaries or functionality
> that the toolchain provides.

### Run target

The primary action in the graph is the run [target](../concepts/target) action, which runs a
project's task as a child process. Tasks can depend on other tasks, and they'll be effectively
orchestrated and executed by running in topological order _and_ in batches via a worker pool.

> This action depends on the previous actions, as the toolchain is used for running the task's
> command, and the outcome of the task is best when the project state is healthy and deterministic.

## What is the graph used for?

Without the dependency graph, tasks would not efficiently, or possibly at all! The graph helps to
run tasks in parallel, in the correct order, and to ensure a reliable outcome.
