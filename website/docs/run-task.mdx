Even though we've [created a task](./create-task), it's not useful unless we _run it_, which is done
with the [`moon run <target>`](./commands/run) command. This command requires a single argument, a
[primary target](./concepts/target), which is the pairing of a project ID and task ID. In the
example below, our project is `app`, the task is `typecheck`, and the target is `app:typecheck`.

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck
```

When this command is ran, it will do the following:

- Generate a directed acyclic graph, known as the dependency graph.
- Insert [`deps`](./config/project#deps) as targets into the graph.
- Insert the primary target into the graph.
- Run all tasks in the graph in parallel and in topological order (the dependency chain).
- For each task, calculate [hashes](./concepts/cache) and either:
  - On cache hit, exit early and return the last run.
  - On cache miss, run the task and generate a new cache.

## Running dependents

moon will _always_ run upstream dependencies ([`deps`](./config/project#deps)) before running the
primary target, as their outputs may be required for the primary target to function correctly.

However, if you're working on a project that is shared and consumed by other projects, you may want
to verify that downstream dependents have not been indirectly broken by any changes. This can be
achieved by passing the `--dependents` option, which will run dependent targets (of the same task
ID) _after_ the primary target.

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck --dependents
```

## Running based on affected files only

By default [`moon run`](./commands/run) will _always_ run the target, regardless if files have
actually changed. However, this is typically fine because of our
[smart hashing & cache layer](./concepts/cache). With that being said, if you'd like to _only_ run a
target if files have changed, pass the `--affected` flag.

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck --affected
```

Under the hood, we extract locally touched (created, modified, staged, etc) files from your
configured [VCS](./config/workspace#vcs), and exit early if no files intersect with the task's
[inputs](./config/project#inputs).

### Using upstream changes

If you'd like to determine affected files based on upstream changes instead of local changes, pass
the `--upstream` flag. This will extract touched files by comparing the current `HEAD` against the
[`vcs.defaultBranch`](./config/workspace#defaultbranch).

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck --affected --upstream
```

### Filtering based on change status

We can take this a step further by filtering down affected files based on a change status, using the
`--status` option. This option accepts the following values: `added`, `deleted`, `modified`,
`staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`. If not provided, the option defaults to all.

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck --affected --status deleted
```

## Passing arguments to the underlying command

If you'd like to pass arbitrary arguments to the underlying task command, in addition to the already
defined [`args`](./config/project#args), you can pass them after `--`. These arguments are _appended
as-is_.

```shell
$ moon run app:typecheck -- --force
```

> The `--` delimiter and any arguments _must_ be defined last on the command line.
