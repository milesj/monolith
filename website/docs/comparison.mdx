The following comparisons are _not_ an exhaustive list of features, and may be inaccurate or out of
date, but represent a good starting point for investigation. If something is not correct, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/issues) or
[submit a patch](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/blob/master/website/src/components/ComparisonTable.tsx).

Before diving into our comparisons below, we highly suggest reading
[monorepo.tools](https://monorepo.tools/) for a deeper insight into monorepos and available tooling.
Although moon is not included, it's a great resource for learning about the current state of things
and the ecosystem.

## Questions

### moon versus competitors?

moon is currently in its infancy (we're not even at v1 yet), and as such, we're missing some very
important features like cloud caching. Once we've progressed further, we will provide more in-depth
articles comparing moon to other tools, but in the meantime, what we _do offer_ that others do not
is:

- An integrated toolchain, ensuring the same version of Node.js (and other tools) is used across all
  machines.
- Automation of common JavaScript problems, like `package.json` dependencies, `tsconfig.json`
  project references, and more.
- Easy task declaration and inheritance across the entire workspace. Define a task once for _all_
  projects.
- First-class continuous integration (CI) support.

With that being said, we also suggest these wonderful articles provided by the community:

### What about Lerna?

Lerna was a fantastic tool that helped the JavaScript ecosystem grow and excelled at package
versioning and publishing (and still does), but it offered a very rudimentary build system. While
Lerna was able to run scripts in parallel, it wasn't the most efficient, as it did not support
caching, hashing, or performant scheduling.

However, the reason Lerna is not compared below, is that Lerna was unowned and maintained for quite
some time, and has recently fallen under the Nx umbrella.
