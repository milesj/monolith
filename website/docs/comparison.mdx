## Questions

### What about Lerna?

Lerna was a fantastic tool that helped the JavaScript ecosystem grow and excelled at package
versioning and publishing (and still does), but it offered a very rudimentary build system. While
Lerna was able to run scripts in parallel, it wasn't the most efficient, as it did not support
caching, hashing, or performant scheduling.

However, the reason Lerna is not compared below, is that Lerna was unowned and maintained for quite
some time, and has recently fallen under the Nx umbrella.
