title: Open source usage

Although moon was designed for large monorepos, it can also be used for open source projects,
especially when coupled with our [built-in continuous integration support](./ci).

However, a pain point with moon is that it only supports a single Node.js version within its
[toolchain](../concepts/toolchain), but open source projects typically need to run checks against
multiple Node.js versions! To mitigate this problem, we built the
[`moonrepo/tool-version-action`](https://github.com/moonrepo/tool-version-action) GitHub Action,
which will override the Node.js version configured in the workspace.

This action works best when paired with a matrix, as demonstrated below!

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
name: 'Pipeline'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
  pull_request:
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: ['ubuntu-latest', 'windows-latest']
        node-version: [14, 16, 18]
    steps:
      # Checkout repository
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v3'
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      # Install Node.js so we can install dependencies
      - uses: 'actions/setup-node@v3'
        with:
          cache: 'yarn'
      # Set Node.js version to use in moon
      - uses: 'moonrepo/tool-version-action@v1'
        with:
          node: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      # Install dependencies
      - run: 'yarn install --immutable'
      # Run moon and affected tasks
      - run: 'yarn moon ci'
```

:::info

Currently, we only have a solution for GitHub actions, but the same mechanism can be applied to
other CI environments by setting the `MOON_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

## Reporting run results

We also suggest using our
[`moonrepo/run-report-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/moon-ci-run-reports) GitHub
action. This action will report the results of a [`moon ci`](../commands/ci) run to a pull request
as a comment and workflow summary.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      # ...
      - run: 'yarn moon ci'
      - uses: 'moonrepo/run-report-action@v1'
        if: success() || failure()
        with:
          access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The report looks something like the following:
