title: Open source usage
---

Although moon was designed for large monorepos, it can also be used for open source projects,
especially when coupled with our [built-in continuous integration support](./ci).

However, a pain point with moon is that it only supports a single Node.js version within its
[toolchain](../concepts/toolchain), but open source projects typically need to run checks against
multiple Node.js versions! To mitigate this problem, we built the
[`moonrepo/tool-version-action`](https://github.com/moonrepo/tool-version-action) GitHub Action,
which will override the Node.js version configured in the workspace.

This action works best when paired with a matrix, as demonstrated below!

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
name: 'Pipeline'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
  pull_request:
jobs:
  ci:
    name: 'CI'
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        node-version: [14, 16, 18]
    steps:
      # Checkout repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      # Install Node.js so we can install dependencies
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      # Set Node.js version to use in moon
      - uses: moonrepo/tool-version-action@v1
        with:
          node: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      # Install dependencies
      - run: yarn install --immutable
      # Run moon and affected tasks
      - run: yarn moon ci
```

:::info

Currently, we only have a solution for GitHub actions, but the same mechanism can be applied to
other CI environments by setting the `MOON_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.
