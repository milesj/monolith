title: Git hooks

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are a mechanism for running
scripts at pre-defined phases in git's lifecycle, most commonly pre-commit, pre-push, or pre-merge.

While moon provides no functionality for managing hooks (_yet_), you can run moon itself from hooks!
This is useful for ensuring that commit messages are formatted correctly, or that source code
quality thresholds are met.

## Pre-commit

A perfect use case for the `pre-commit` hook is to check linting and formatting of the files being
committed. If either of these tasks fail, the commit will abort until they are fixed. Be sure to use
the [`--affected`](../run-task#running-based-on-affected-files-only) option so that we _only run_ on
changed projects!

```bash title=".git/hooks/pre-commit"
#!/bin/sh
./node_modules/@moonrepo/cli/moon run :lint :format --affected --status=staged
```

> By default this will run on the _entire_ project (all files). If you want to filter it to only the
> changed files, enable the [`affectedFiles`](../config/project#affectedfiles) task option.
