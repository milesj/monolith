Code generation provides an easy mechanism for automating common development workflows and file
structures. Whether it's scaffolding a new library or application, updating configuration, or
standardizing patterns.

To accomplish this, we provide a generator, which is divided into two parts. The first being the
templates and their files to be scaffolded. The second is our rendering engine that writes template
files to a destination.

## Creating a new template

To create a new template, run [`moon generate`][command] while passing the `--template` option. This
will create a template directory and [`template.yml`][config] file in the 1st configured template
location defined in [`generator.templates`][gen-templates].

```shell
$ moon generate <name> --template
```

### Configuring `template.yml`

Every template requires a [`template.yml`][config] file in the template's directory root. This file
acts as a schema and declares metadata and variables required by the generator.

```yaml title="template.yml"
title: 'npm package'
description: |
  Scaffolds the initial structure for an npm package,
  including source and test folders, a package.json, and more.
variables:
  name:
    type: 'string'
    default: ''
    required: true
    prompt: 'Package name?'
```

### Managing files

Feel free to add any files and folders to the template that you'd like to be generated by consumers!
These files will then be scaffolded 1:1 in structure at the target destination. With that being
said, there are a few unique scenarios to be aware of!

- File paths that contain the word "partial" will not be scaffolded. This is to support composition
  and inheritance between templates using
  [`{% include ... %}`](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#include).
- Variables can be interpolated into file paths using the form `[varName]`. For example, if you had
  a template file `src/[type].ts`, and a variable `type` with a value of "bin", then the destination
  file path would be `src/bin.ts`.

An example of the templates folder structure may look something like the following:

```
templates/
├── npm-package/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── template.yml
└── react-app/
```

### Template engine & syntax

Rendering templates is powered by [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/), a Rust based template engine
with syntax similar to Twig, Liquid, Django, and more. We highly encourage everyone to read Tera's
documentation for an in-depth understanding, but as a quick reference, Tera supports the following:

- [Variable interpolation](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#variables) (defined with the
  [`variables`](../config/template#variables) setting), with
  [built-in filters](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#built-ins).

```twig
{{ varName }} -> foo
{{ varName | upper }} -> FOO
```

- [Conditional blocks](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#if) and
  [loops](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#for).

```twig
{% if price < 10 or always_show %}
	Price is {{ price }}.
{% elif price > 1000 and not rich %}
	That's expensive!
{% else %}
	N/A
{% endif %}
```

```twig
{% for item in items %}
	{{ loop.index }} - {{ item.name }}
{% endfor %}
```

- And many more features, like auto-escaping, white space control, and math operators!

#### Filters

Filters are a mechanism for transforming values during interpolation and are written using pipes
(`|`). Tera provides many [built-in filters](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/#built-in-filters), but
we also provide the following custom filters:

- Strings - `camel_case`, `pascal_case`, `snake_case`, `upper_snake_case`, `kebab_case`,
  `upper_kebab_case`

## Generating code from a template

Once a template has been created and configured, you can generate files based on it using the
[`moon generate`][command] command! This is also know as scaffolding or code generation.

This command requires the name of a template as the 1st argument. The template name is the folder
name on the file system that houses all the template files.

```shell
$ moon generate npm-package
```

An optional destination path, relative from the current working directory, can be provided as the
2nd argument. If not provided, you'll be prompted during generation to provide one.

```shell
$ moon generate npm-package ./packages/example
```

> This command is extremely interactive, as we'll prompt you for the destination path, variable
> values, whether to overwrite files, and more. If you'd prefer to avoid interactions, pass
> `--defaults`, or `--force`, or both.

### Configuring template locations

Templates can be located anywhere, especially when [being shared](#sharing-templates). Because of
this, our generator will loop through all template paths configured in
[`generator.templates`][gen-templates], in order, until a match is found (template name matches the
folder name).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
generator:
	templates:
		- './templates'
		- './other/templates'
```

### Declaring variables with CLI arguments

During generation, you'll be prompted in the terminal to provide a value for any configured
variables. However, you can pre-fill these variable values by passing arbitray command line
arguments after `--` to [`moon generate`][command]. Argument names must exactly match the variable
names.

Using the package template example above, we could pre-fill the `name` variable like so:

```shell
$ moon generate npm-package ./packages/example -- --name '@company/example' --private
```

> Boolean variables can be negated by prefixing the argument with `--no-<arg>`.

## Sharing templates

Although moon is designed for a monorepo, you may be using multiple repositories and would like to
use the same templates across all of them.

This is technically possible, but with 1 caveat, and that is that moon's generator requires
templates to exist within the current repository, relative from the workspace root. So how can we
share templates across repositories? Why not try...

- git submodules
- npm packages
- another packaging system

Regardless of the choice, simply configure [`generator.templates`][gen-templates] to point to these
locations:

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
generator:
	templates:
		- './templates'
		- './node_modules/@company/shared-templates'
		- './path/to/submodules'
```

[config]: ../config/template
[command]: ../commands/generate
[gen-templates]: ../config/workspace#templates
