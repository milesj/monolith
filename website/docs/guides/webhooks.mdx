## Events

### Runner

Runs actions within moon using a robust dependency graph. Is triggered when using
[`moon run`](../commands/run).

#### `runner.started`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadRunnerStarted" />

Triggered when the runner has been created but before actions have started to run.

This event includes the number of actions registered within the runner, but does not provide
detailed information about the actions. Use the [`action.*`](#actionstarted) events for this.

```json
{
  "type": "runner.started",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "actionsCount": 15
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `runner.finished`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadRunnerFinished" />

Triggered when the runner has finished running all actions, with aggregated counts based on final
status.

This event is _not_ triggered if the runner crashes (this does not include actions that have failed,
as those are legitimate runs). Use the [`runner.aborted`](#runneraborted) event if you want to also
catch crashes.

```json
{
  "type": "runner.finished",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "cachedCount": 10,
    "duration": {
      "secs": 120,
      "nanos": 3591693
    },
    "failedCount": 1,
    "passedCount": 4
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `runner.aborted`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadRunnerAborted" />

Triggered when the runner has crashed for unknown reasons, or had to abort as a result of a critical
action failing.

```json
{
  "type": "runner.aborted",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "error": "..."
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### Actions

Actions are "jobs" within the runner that are executed topologically.

#### `action.started`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadActionStarted" />

Triggered when an action within the runner has started to run.

```json
{
  "type": "action.started",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "action": {
      "attempts": null,
      "createdAt": "...",
      "duration": {
        "secs": 0,
        "nanos": 3591693
      },
      "error": null,
      "label": "InstallNodeDeps(18.0.0)",
      "nodeIndex": 5,
      "status": "passed"
    },
    "node": {
      "action": "InstallDeps",
      "params": [
        {
          "platform": "Node",

    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `action.finished`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadActionFinished" />

Triggered when an action within the runner has finished running, either with a success or failure.
If the action failed, the `error` field will be set with the error message.

```json
{
  "type": "action.finished",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "action": {
      "attempts": null,

project, the `project` field will be set, otherwise `null` for the entire workspace. If the install
failed, the `error` field will be set with the error message.

For more information about the action, refer to the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event.
Installed deps can be scoped with the `InstallDeps(...)` labels.

```json

    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `project.syncing`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadProjectSyncing" />

```

#### `tool.installing`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadToolInstalling" />

Triggered when a tool within the toolchain has started downloading and installing.

This event is _always_ triggered, regardless of whether the tool has already been installed or not.
For an accurate state, use the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event. If the `status` is
"skipped", then the tool was already installed.

```json
{
  "type": "tool.installing",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "runtime": {
      "platform": "Node",
      "version": "18.0.0"

}
```

#### `tool.installed`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadToolInstalled" />

Triggered when a tool within the toolchain has finished installing. If the install failed, the
`error` field will be set with the error message.

For more information about the action, refer to the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event.
Tools can be scoped with the `SetupTool(...)` labels.

```json

[`moon run`](../commands/run)).

```json
{
  "type": "target.running",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

field will be set with the error message.

For more information about the action, refer to the [`action.finished`](#actionfinished) event. Ran
targets can be scoped with the `RunTarget(...)` labels.

```json
{
  "type": "target.ran",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "error": null,
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

### Targets

Targets to run. Each event contains a `hash` field, that is a unique SHA-256 identifier for the the
target's hashed contents.

#### `target-output.cache-check`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputCacheCheck" />

Triggered when the runner is checking for a cached archive of the currently running target.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.cache-check",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "target": "app:build"
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `target-output.archiving`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputArchiving" />

Triggered when the [outputs](../config/project#outputs) of a task are being cached into a tarball
archive. This archive will be stored within `.moon/cache/outputs` on the host machine.

This event _does not_ trigger if the task has no `outputs`.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.archiving",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",

      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `target-output.archived`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputArchived" />

Triggered when the [outputs](../config/project#outputs) of a task have been archived and stored in
the `.moon/cache/outputs` directory. The `archivePath` field is an absolute path to this archive,
_but_ is unique to the host machine that the target ran on.

This event _does not_ trigger if [`target-output.archiving`](#targetoutputarchiving) did not run or
failed to run.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.archived",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "archivePath": "...",
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `target-output.hydrating`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputHydrating" />

Triggered when a target has a cache hit for the generated hash (a cached archive exists on the local
file system) and the archive is being unpacked into the project directory at the defined
[outputs](../config/project#outputs).

This event _does not_ trigger if the task has no `outputs`, or there was a cache miss (no matching
archive).

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.hydrating",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```

#### `target-output.hydrated`

<HeadingApiLink to="/api/types#PayloadTargetOutputHydrated" />

Triggered when a target has hydrated a project with the contents of a cached archive. The
`archivePath` field is an absolute path to this archive, _but_ is unique to the host machine that
the target ran on.

This event _does not_ trigger if [`target-output.hydrating`](#targetoutputhydrating) did not run or
failed to run.

```json
{
  "type": "target-output.hydrated",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "event": {
    "archivePath": "...",
    "hash": "1f5205cdb0912e97190e08a6cf98e41804bf6824b0a325d315e8b488a12677b0",
    "project": {
      "id": "app"
      // ...
    },
    "target": "app:build",
    "task": {
      "id": "build"
      // ...
    }
  },
  "uuid": "..."
}
```
