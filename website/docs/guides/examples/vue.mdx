import AddDepsTabs from '@site/src/components/AddDepsTabs';

Vue is an application or library concern, and not a build system one, since the bundling of Vue is
abstracted away through another tool like webpack. Because of this, moon has no guidelines around
utilizing Vue directly. You can use Vue however you wish!

However, with that being said, we do suggest the following:

- Prefer [Vite and the Vue CLI](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support) for all
  tooling needs (encapsulated as moon tasks).
- Add `vue` and related dependencies to each project, not the root. This will ensure accurate
  [hashing](../../concepts/cache#hashing).

<AddDepsTabs dep="vue" package="<project>" />

- Configure [TypeScript](./typescript) compiler options with `"jsx": "preserve"`. Be sure other
  options are based on
  [`@vue/tsconfig`](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#configuring-tsconfig-json).
