Is your CI pipeline running slower than usual? Are you tired of running the same build over and over
although nothing has changed? Do you wish to reuse the same local cache across other machines and
environments? These are just a few scenarios that remote caching aims to solve.

Remote caching is a system that shares artifacts to improve performance, reduce unnecessary
computation time, and alleviate resources. It achieves this by uploading hashed artifacts to a cloud
storage provider, like AWS S3 or Google Cloud, and downloading them on demand when a build matches a
derived hash.

## Beta sign up

Remote caching _is not yet_ available for general use and is currently in beta while we iron out the
systems. However, you may sign up for the beta and we'll notify you once you've been accepted!

<RemoteCacheBeta />

> We are only accepting beta sign ups for open source or public facing projects at this time!

## Enabling remote caching

Once your beta signup has been accepted, you'll be granted 2 API keys. The first is the secret key
for your entire organization, and the second is an access key specific to the repository you signed
up for.

In that repositories CI environment, set the following environment variables.

```
MOONBASE_SECRET_KEY=<secret key>
MOONBASE_API_KEY=<api key>
```

moon will automatically authenticate the remote caching service when all credentials in the
environment exist.

## FAQ

#### What is an artifact?

In the context of moon and remote caching, an artifact is a tar archive (`.tar.gz`) that contains
all [outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), as well as the stdout and stderr of the task
that generated the outputs. Artifacts are uniquely identified by the
[moon generated hash](../concepts/cache#hashing).

#### Do I have to use remote caching?

No, remote caching is _optional_. It's intended purpose is to store long lived build artifacts to
speed up CI pipelines, and optionally local development. For the most part,
[`moon ci`](../commands/ci) does a great job of only running what's affected in pull requests, and
is a great starting point.

#### Does remote caching store source code?

No, remote caching _does not_ store source code. It stores the
[outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), which is typically built and compiled code. To
verify this, you can inspect the tar archives in `.moon/cache/outputs`.

#### Does moon collect any personally identifiable information?

No, moon does not collect any PII as part of the remote caching process.

However, to use remote caching, you must create a moonrepo account in which we require an email
address, and information about your organization and repository.

#### What is an artifacts lifetime / retention policy?

Public artifacts are stored for 1 month. Private artifacts are stored for 3 months.
