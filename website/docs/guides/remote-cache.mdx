Is your CI pipeline running slower than usual? Are you tired of running the same build over and over
although nothing has changed? Do you wish to reuse the same local cache across other machines and
environments? These are just a few scenarios that remote caching aims to solve.

Remote caching is a system that shares artifacts to improve performance, reduce unnecessary
computation time, and alleviate resources. It achieves this by uploading hashed artifacts to a cloud
storage provider, like AWS S3 or Google Cloud, and downloading them on demand when a build matches a
derived hash.

## Sign up for an account

Remote caching requires a [moonrepo.app](https://moonrepo.app) account, powered by our
[moonbase](/moonbase) service. Creating an account requires a GitHub account. In the future we'll
support additional OAuth providers.

### Create an organization

A moonbase organization can represent a company, team, group, or personal workspace, and is required
for housing repositories, projects, artifacts, and more. Begin by creating an organization from the
dashboard.

> The "Region" field is very important for remote caching, as it configures which S3 region to store
> artifacts in. This _cannot_ be changed after creation, so choose wisely!

### Create a repository

A moonbase repository is a direct relationship to a codebase repository, and is necessary for
linking artifacts to the appropriate tasks. From an organization's page, you can create a
repository.

> The "Slug" field must match your repository's "remote/repo" naming exactly, as we compare these
> values for authentication purposes.

## Enabling remote caching

Once you have a [moonrepo.app](https://moonrepo.app) account, an organization, and repository, you
can enable remote caching in your CI pipeline. From a moonbase repository page, you can view your
API keys in the actions menu. The first is the secret key for your entire organization, and the
second is an access key specific to that repository.

In that repository's CI environment, set the following environment variables.

```
MOONBASE_SECRET_KEY=<secret key>
MOONBASE_ACCESS_KEY=<access key>
```

moon will automatically authenticate the remote caching service when all credentials in the
environment exist.

> Access keys are unique _per repository_. You'll need different keys for each pipeline!

## FAQ

#### What is an artifact?

In the context of moon and remote caching, an artifact is a tar archive (`.tar.gz`) that contains
all [outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), as well as the stdout and stderr of the task
that generated the outputs. Artifacts are uniquely identified by the
[moon generated hash](../concepts/cache#hashing).

#### Do I have to use remote caching?

No, remote caching is _optional_. It's intended purpose is to store long lived build artifacts to
speed up CI pipelines, and optionally local development. For the most part,
[`moon ci`](../commands/ci) does a great job of only running what's affected in pull requests, and
is a great starting point.

#### Does remote caching store source code?

No, remote caching _does not_ store source code. It stores the
[outputs of a task](../config/project#outputs), which is typically built and compiled code. To
verify this, you can inspect the tar archives in `.moon/cache/outputs`.

#### Does moon collect any personally identifiable information?

No, moon does not collect any PII as part of the remote caching process.

However, to use remote caching, you must create a moonrepo account in which we require an email
address, and information about your organization and repository.

#### Are artifacts encrypted?

Yes! We use AWS's built-in SSE-S3 encryption for all S3 buckets.
