## Caveats

### Inherited tasks

Because a root project is still a project in the workspace, it will inherit all tasks defined in
[`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project), which may be not what you want. To mitigate this,
you can exclude some or all of these tasks in the root config with
[`workspace.inheritedTasks`](config/project#inheritedtasks).

```yaml title="/project.yml"
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    include: []
```
