title: Offline mode
---

moon assumes that an internet connection is always available, as we download and install tools into
the toolchain, resolve versions against upstream manifests, and automatically install dependencies.
While this is useful, having a constant internet connection isn't always viable.

To support workflows where internet isn't available or is spotty, moon will automatically check for
an active internet connection, and drop into offline mode if necessary.

## What's disabled when offline

When offline, moon will skip or disable the following:

- Automatic dependency installation will be skipped.
- Toolchain will skip resolving, downloading, and installing tools, and instead use the local cache.
  - If no local cache available, will fallback to binaries found on `PATH`.
  - If not available on `PATH`, will fail to run.
- Upgrade and version checks will be skipped.

## Toggling modes

While we automatically check for an internet connection, both online and offline modes can be forced
with the `PROTO_OFFLINE` environment variable. Setting the variable to `1` or `true` will force
offline mode, while `0` and `false` will force online mode.
