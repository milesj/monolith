An extension is a WASM plugin that allows you to extend moon with additional functionality, have
whitelisted access to the file system, and receive partial information about the current workspace.
Extensions are extremely useful in offering new and unique functionality that doesn't need to be
built into moon's core. It also enables the community to build and share their own extensions!

## Using extensions

Before an extension can be executed with the [`moon ext`](../commands/ext) command, it must be
configured with the [`extensions`](../config/workspace#extensions) setting in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace) (excluding [built-in's](#built-in-extensions)).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
extensions:
  example:
    plugin: 'source:https://example.com/path/to/example.wasm'
```

Once configured, it can be executed with [`moon ext`](../commands/ext) by name. Arguments unique to
the extension _must_ be passed after a `--` separator.

```shell
$ moon ext example -- --arg1 --arg2
```

## Built-in extensions

moon is shipped with a few built-in extensions that are configured and enabled by default. Official
moon extensions are built and published in our [moonrepo/moon-extensions][repo] repository.

### `download`

The `download` extension can be used to download a file from a URL into the current workspace, as
defined by the `--url` argument. For example, say we want to download the latest [proto](/proto)
binary:

```shell
$ moon ext download --\
  --url https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/latest/download/proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz
```

By default this will download `proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` into the current working
directory. To customize the location, use the `--dest` argument. However, do note that the
destination _must be_ within the current moon workspace, as only certain directories are whitelisted
for WASM.

```shell
$ moon ext download --\
  --url https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/latest/download/proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz\
  --dest ./temp
```

#### Arguments

- `--url` (required) - URL of a file to download.
- `--dest` - Destination folder to save the file. Defaults to the current working directory.
- `--name` - Override the file name. Defaults to the file name in the URL.
