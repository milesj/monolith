An extension is a WASM plugin that allows you to extend moon with additional functionality, have
whitelisted access to the file system, and receive partial information about the current workspace.
Extensions are extremely useful in offering new and unique functionality that doesn't need to be
built into moon's core. It also enables the community to build and share their own extensions!

## Using extensions

Before an extension can be executed with the [`moon ext`](../commands/ext) command, it must be
configured with the [`extensions`](../config/workspace#extensions) setting in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace) (excluding [built-in's](#built-in-extensions)).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
extensions:
  example:
    plugin: 'source:https://example.com/path/to/example.wasm'
```

Once configured, it can be executed with [`moon ext`](../commands/ext) by name. Arguments unique to
the extension _must_ be passed after a `--` separator.

```shell
$ moon ext example -- --arg1 --arg2
```

## Built-in extensions

moon is shipped with a few built-in extensions that are configured and enabled by default. Official
moon extensions are built and published in our [moonrepo/moon-extensions][repo] repository.

### `download`

The `download` extension can be used to download a file from a URL into the current workspace, as
defined by the `--url` argument. For example, say we want to download the latest [proto](/proto)
binary:

```shell
$ moon ext download --\
  --url https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/latest/download/proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz
```

By default this will download `proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` into the current working
directory. To customize the location, use the `--dest` argument. However, do note that the
destination _must be_ within the current moon workspace, as only certain directories are whitelisted
for WASM.

```shell
$ moon ext download --\
  --url https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/latest/download/proto_cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz\
  --dest ./temp
```

#### Arguments

- `--url` (required) - URL of a file to download.
- `--dest` - Destination folder to save the file. Defaults to the current working directory.
- `--name` - Override the file name. Defaults to the file name in the URL.

## Creating an extension

Refer to our [official WASM guide](./wasm-plugins) for more information on how our WASM plugins
work, critical concepts to know, how to create a plugin, and more. Once you have a good
understanding, you may continue this specific guide.

:::note

Refer to our [moonrepo/moon-extensions][repo] repository for in-depth examples.

### Implementing execution

Extensions support a single plugin function, `execute_extension`, which is called by the
[`moon ext`](../commands/ext) command to execute the extension. This is where all your business
logic will reside.

```rust
use extism_pdk::*;
use moon_pdk::{*, extension::*};

#[host_fn]
extern "ExtismHost" {
    fn host_log(input: Json<HostLogInput>);
}

#[plugin_fn]
pub fn execute_extension(Json(input): Json<ExecuteExtensionInput>) -> FnResult<()> {
  host_log!(stdout, "Executing extension!");

  Ok(())
}
```

### Supporting arguments

Most extensions will require arguments, as it provides a mechanism for users to pass information
into the WASM runtime. To parse arguments, we provide the
[`Args`](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/trait.Args.html) trait/macro from the
[clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) crate. Refer to their
[official documentation on usage](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html) (we don't
support everything).

```rust
use moon_pdk::args::*;

#[derive(Args)]
pub struct ExampleExtensionArgs {
  // --url, -u
  #[arg(long, short = 'u', required = true)]
  pub url: String,
}
```

Once your struct has been defined, you can parse the provided input arguments using the
[`parse_args`](https://docs.rs/moon_pdk/latest/moon_pdk/args/fn.parse_args.html) function.

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn execute_extension(Json(input): Json<ExecuteExtensionInput>) -> FnResult<()> {
  let args = parse_args::<ExampleExtensionArgs>(&input.args)?;

  args.url; // --url

  Ok(())
}
```

### Supporting configuration

Users can configure [extensions](../config/workspace#extensions) with additional settings in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace). Do note that settings should be in camelCase for them
to be parsed correctly!

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
extensions:
  example:
    plugin: 'source:./path/to/example.wasm'
    someSetting: 'abc'
    anotherSetting: 123
```

In the plugin, we can map these settings (excluding `plugin`) into a struct. The `Default` trait
must be implemented to handle situations where settings were not configured, or some are missing.

```rust
config_struct!(
  #[derive(Default)]
  pub struct ExampleExtensionConfig {
    pub some_setting: String,
    pub another_setting: u32,
  }
);
```

Once your struct has been defined, you can access the configuration using the
[`get_extension_config`](https://docs.rs/moon_pdk/latest/moon_pdk/extension/fn.get_extension_config.html)
function

```rust
#[plugin_fn]
pub fn execute_extension(Json(input): Json<ExecuteExtensionInput>) -> FnResult<()> {
  let config = get_extension_config::<ExampleExtensionConfig>()?;

  config.another_setting; // 123

  Ok(())
}
```
