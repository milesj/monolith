title: Docker usage
---

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run your applications? Or build your artifacts? No
worries, moon can be utilized with Docker! For the most part, everything should just work, but we
have disabled caching and hashing in Docker containers and images for the following reasons:

- Avoids having to mount a volume for the `.git` directory.
- Reduces the overall image size as we're avoiding creating tarballs.
- Ensures that builds are fresh and up-to-date.

## Dockerfile

This is merely an example of using moon within a `Dockerfile` while taking advantage of its layer
caching. The final 2 steps should be customized to your project's needs!

```docker
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

# Copy moon files
COPY ./.moon/project.yml ./.moon/workspace.yml ./.moon/

# Copy all package.json's and lockfiles
COPY ...
COPY ./package.json ./package.json
COPY ./yarn.lock ./yarn.lock

# Install toolchain and dependencies
RUN moon setup

# Copy project and required files
COPY ./app/example/project ./app/example/project
COPY ...

# Run target
CMD ["moon", "run", "project:task"]
```
