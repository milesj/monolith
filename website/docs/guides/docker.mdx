title: Docker usage
---

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run your applications? Or build your artifacts? No
worries, moon can be utilized within Docker containers! For the most part, everything should just
work, but we have disabled caching and hashing in Docker containers for the following reasons:

- Avoids having to mount a volume for the `.git` directory.
- Reduces the overall image size as we're avoiding creating tarballs.
- Ensures that builds are fresh.

## Dockerfile

This is merely an example of using moon within a `Dockerfile` while taking advantage of its layer
caching. The final 2 steps should be customized to your project's needs!

```docker
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Install moon binary
RUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli

# Copy moon files
COPY ./.moon ./.moon

# Install toolchain
RUN moon setup

# Copy repo
COPY . .

# Run target
CMD ["moon", "run", "project:task"]
```
