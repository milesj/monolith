title: Tasks
---

Tasks are commands that are ran in the context of a [project](./project). Underneath the hood, a
task is simply a binary or system command that is ran as a child process.

## Names

A task name (or identifier) is a unique resource for locating a task _within_ a project. The name is
explicitly configured as a key within the [`tasks`](../config/project#tasks) setting, and can be
written in camel/kebab/snake case. Names support `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`, and must start
with a character.

A task name can be paired with a project name to create a [target](./target).

## Types

Tasks are categorized into 1 of the following types based on their configured parameters.

- **Build** - Task generates one or many artifacts, and is derived from the
  [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs) setting.
- **Run** - Task runs a one-off, long-running, or never-ending process, and is derived from the
  [`local`](../config/project#local) or [`runInCI`](../config/project#runinci) settings.
- **Test** - Task asserts code is correct and behaves as expected. This includes linting,
  typechecking, unit tests, and any other form of testing.

## Configuration

Tasks can be configured per project through [`moon.yml`](../config/project), or for many projects
through [`.moon/tasks.yml`][tasks].

## Inheritance

Unlike other build systems that require the same tasks to be repeatedly defined for _every_ project,
moon uses an inheritance model where tasks can be defined once at the workspace-level, and are then
inherited by _many or all_ projects.

Workspace-level tasks (also known as global tasks) are defined in [`.moon/tasks.yml`][tasks] or
[`.moon/tasks/*.yml`][tasks], and are inherited by default. However, projects are able to include,
exclude, or rename inherited tasks using the
[`workspace.inheritedTasks`](../config/project#inheritedtasks) in [`moon.yml`](../config/project).

### Scope by project language and type

By default tasks defined in [`.moon/tasks.yml`][tasks] will be inherited by _all_ projects. This
approach works well when a monorepo is comprised of a single programming language, but breaks down
quickly in multi-language setups.

To support these complex repositories, we support scoped tasks with [`.moon/tasks/*.yml`][tasks],
where `*.yml` maps to a project based on a combination of its [language][language] and [type][type].
This enables you to easily declare tasks for "JavaScript projects", "Go applications", "Ruby
libraries", so on and so forth.

When resolving configuration files, moon will locate and _shallow_ merge files in the following
order, from widest scope to narrowest scope:

- `.moon/tasks.yml` - All projects.
- `.moon/tasks/<language>.yml` - Projects with a matching [`language`][language] setting.
- `.moon/tasks/<language>-<type>.yml` - Projects with matching [`language`][language] and
  [`type`][type] settings.

As mentioned above, all of these files are shallow merged into a single "global tasks" configuration
that is unique per-project. Merging **does not** utilize the [merge strategies](#merge-strategies)
below, as those strategies are only utilized when merging global and local tasks.

#### JavaScript platforms

Unlike most languages that have 1 runtime, JavaScript has 3 (Node.js, Deno, Bun), and we must
support repositories that are comprised of any combination of these 3. As such, JavaScript (and
TypeScript) based projects have a special lookup order using
[`platform`](../config/project#platform) to account for this:

- `.moon/tasks.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/<platform>.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/<language>.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/<platform>-<type>.yml`
- `.moon/tasks/<language>-<type>.yml`

For example, `node.yml` would be inherited for Node.js projects, `bun-library.yml` for Bun
libraries, and `deno-application.yml` for Deno applications. While `javascript.yml`,
`typescript-library.yml`, etc, will be inherited for all platforms.

### Merge strategies

When a [global task](../config/tasks#tasks) and [local task](../config/project#tasks) of the same
name exist, they are merged into a single task. To accomplish this, one of many
[merge strategies](../config/project#options) can be used.

Merging is applied to the parameters [`args`](../config/project#args),
[`deps`](../config/project#deps), [`env`](../config/project#env-1),
[`inputs`](../config/project#inputs), and [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs), using the
[`mergeArgs`](../config/project#mergeargs), [`mergeDeps`](../config/project#mergedeps),
[`mergeEnv`](../config/project#mergeenv), [`mergeInputs`](../config/project#mergeinputs) and
[`mergeOutputs`](../config/project#mergeoutputs) options respectively. Each of these options support
one of the following strategy values.

- `append` (default) - Values found in the local task are merged _after_ the values found in the
  global task. For example, this strategy is useful for toggling flag arguments.
- `prepend` - Values found in the local task are merged _before_ the values found in the global
  task. For example, this strategy is useful for applying option arguments that must come before
  positional arguments.
- `replace` - Values found in the local task entirely _replaces_ the values in the global task. This
  strategy is useful when you need full control.

All 3 of these strategies are demonstrated below, with a somewhat contrived example, but you get the
point.

```yaml
# Global
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'webpack'
      - '--mode'
      - 'production'
      - '--color'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
    inputs:
      - '/webpack.config.js'
    outputs:
      - 'build/'

# Local
tasks:
  build:
    args: '--no-color --no-stats'
    deps:
      - 'reactHooks:build'
    inputs:
      - 'webpack.config.js'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'append'
      mergeDeps: 'prepend'
      mergeInputs: 'replace'

# Merged result
tasks:
  build:
    command:
      - 'webpack'
      - '--mode'
      - 'production'
      - '--color'
      - '--no-color'

    options:

      mergeDeps: 'prepend'
      mergeInputs: 'replace'
