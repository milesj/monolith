title: Tasks

Tasks are commands that are ran in the context of a [project](./project). Underneath the hood, a
task is simply an npm binary or a system/shell command that is ran as a child-process. Tasks are
processed in a parallel thread pool within Moon's orchestration layer.

## Targets

A target is an identifier that pairs a project to an owned task, in the format of
"project_id:task_id". Targets are used by terminal commands...

```shell
$ moon run designSystem:build
```

And configurations for declaring cross-project or cross-task dependencies.

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
```

## Tokens

Tokens are variables and functions that can be used by [`args`](../config/project#args),
[`inputs`](../config/project#inputs), and [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs) when configuring a
task. They provide a way of accessing file group paths, referencing values from other task fields,
and referencing metadata about the project and task itself.

### Functions

A token function is labeled as such as it takes a single argument, starts with an `@`, and is
formatted as `@name(arg)`. The following token functions are available, grouped by their
functionality.

> Token functions _must_ be the only content within a list item, as they expand to multiple file
> paths.

#### File groups

These functions reference file groups by name, where the name is passed as the argument.

##### `@dirs`

> Usable in `args` and `inputs`.

The `@dirs(file_group)` token will be replaced with an expanded list of directory paths, derived
from the file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will
walk the file system and aggregate all directories found.

When used in `args`, it will return relative or absolute paths, depending on run context, while
`inputs` will return absolute paths.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  lintable:
    - 'src'
    - 'tests'
    - 'scripts'

# Configured as
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    args:
      - '@dirs(lintable)'
      - '--color'
    inputs:
      - '@dirs(lintable)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    args:
      - 'src'
      - 'tests'
      - 'scripts'
      - '--color'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
      - '/path/to/project/tests'
      - '/path/to/project/scripts'
```

##### `@files`

> Usable in `args` and `inputs`.

The `@files(file_group)` token will be replaced with an expanded list of file paths, derived from
the file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will walk
the file system and aggregate all files found.

When used in `args`, it will return relative or absolute paths, depending on run context, while
`inputs` will return absolute paths.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  config:
    - '*.config.js'
    - 'package.json'

# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '@files(config)'
    inputs:
      - '@files(config)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - 'babel.config.js'
      - 'webpack.config.js'
      - 'package.json'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/babel.config.js'
      - '/path/to/project/webpack.config.js'
      - '/path/to/project/package.json'
```

##### `@globs`

> Usable in `args` and `inputs`.

The `@globs(file_group)` token will be replaced with an expanded list of glob patterns (as-is),
derived from the file group of the same name. If a non-glob pattern is detected within the file
group, it will be ignored.

When used in `args`, it will return relative or absolute paths, depending on run context, while
`inputs` will return absolute paths _and_ also be used in affected files detection by matching
against the patterns.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'

# Configured as
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      - '--testMatch'
      - '@globs(tests)'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(tests)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      - '--testMatch'
      - 'tests/**/*'
      - '**/__tests__/**/*'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/tests/**/*'
      - '/path/to/project/**/__tests__/**/*'
```

##### `@root`

> Usable in `args` and `inputs`.

The `@root(file_group)` token will be replaced with the lowest common directory, derived from the
file group of the same name. If a glob pattern is detected within the file group, it will walk the
file system and aggregate all directories found before reducing.

When used in `args`, it will return relative paths, while `inputs` will return absolute paths.

```yaml
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/app'
    - 'src/packages'
    - 'src/scripts'

# Configured as
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
    args:
      - '--write'
      - '@root(sources)'
    inputs:
      - '@root(sources)'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
    args:
      - '--write'
      - 'src'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
```

> When there's no directies, or too many directories, this function will return the project root
> using `.`.

#### Inputs & outputs

##### `@in`

> Usable in `args` only.

The `@in(index)` token will be replaced with a single path, derived from `inputs` by numerical
index. If a glob pattern is referenced by index, the glob will be used as-is, instead of returning
the expanded list of files.

```yaml
# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'babel'
    args:
      - '--copy-files'
      - '--config-file'
      - '@in(1)'
      - '@in(0)'
    inputs:
      - 'src'
      - 'babel.config.js'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'babel'
    args:
      - '--copy-files'
      - '--config-file'
      - 'babel.config.js'
      - 'src'
    inputs:
      - '/path/to/project/src'
      - '/path/to/project/babel.config.js'
```

##### `@out`

> Usable in `args` only.

The `@out(index)` token will be replaced with a single path, derived from `outputs` by numerical
index. If a glob pattern is referenced by index, the process will **fail**, as it requires literal
folder and file paths.

```yaml
# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'babel'
    args:
      - '.'
      - '--out-dir'
      - '@out(0)'
    outputs:
      - 'lib'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'babel'
    args:
      - '.'
      - '--out-dir'
      - 'lib'
    outputs:
      - '/path/to/project/lib'
```

### Variables

> Usable in `args` only.

A token variable is a value that starts with `$` and is substituted to a value derived from the
current workspace, project, and task. The following variables are available:

- `$project` - ID of the project that owns the currently running task, as defined in
  `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- `$projectSource` - Relative file path from the workspace root to the project root, as defined in
  `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- `$projectRoot` - Absolute file path to the project root.
- `$target` - Target that is currently running. Is a combination of project and task IDs.
- `$task` - ID of the task that is currently running.
- `$workspaceRoot` - Absolute file path to the workspace root.

> Unlike token functions, token variables can be placed _within_ content when necessary.

```yaml
# Configured as
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'example'
    args:
      - '$target'
      - '--cache-dir'
      - '../../.cache/$projectSource'
      - '--project'
      - '$project'
      - '--task=$task'

# Resolves to
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'example'
    args:
      - 'web:build'
      - '--cache-dir'
      - '../../.cache/apps/web'
      - '--project'
      - 'web'
      - '--task=build'
```

## Merge strategies

When a [global task](../config/global-project#tasks) and [local task](../config/project#tasks) of
the same name exist, they are merged into a single task. To accomplish this, one of many
[merge strategies](../config/project#options) can be used.

Merging is applied to the parameters `args`, `deps`, `env`, `inputs`, and `outputs`, using the
`mergeArgs`, `mergeDeps`, `mergeEnv`, `mergeInputs` and `mergeOutputs` options respectively. Each of
these options support one of the following strategy values.

- `append` (default) - Values found in the local task are merged _after_ the values found in the
  global task. For example, this strategy is useful for toggling flag arguments.
- `prepend` - Values found in the local task are merged _before_ the values found in the global
  task. For example, this strategy is useful for applying option arguments that must come before
  positional arguments.
- `replace` - Values found in the local task entirely _replaces_ the values in the global task. This
  strategy is useful when you need full control.

All 3 of these strategies are demonstrated below, with a somewhat contrived example, but you get the
point.

```yaml
# Global
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    args:
      - '--mode'
      - 'production'
      - '--color'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
    inputs:
      - '/webpack.config.js'
    outputs:
      - 'build/'

# Local
tasks:
  build:
    args:
      - '--no-color'
      - '--no-stats'
    deps:
      - 'reactHooks:build'
    inputs:
      - 'webpack.config.js'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'append'
      mergeDeps: 'prepend'
      mergeInputs: 'replace'

# Merged result
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    args:
      - '--mode'
      - 'production'
      - '--color'
      - '--no-color'
      - '--no-stats'
    deps:
      - 'reactHooks:build'
      - 'designSystem:build'
    inputs:
      - 'webpack.config.js'
    outputs:
      - 'build/'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'append'
      mergeDeps: 'prepend'
      mergeInputs: 'replace'
```
