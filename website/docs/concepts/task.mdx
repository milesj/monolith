Tasks are commands that are ran in the context of a [project](./project). Underneath the hood, a
task is simply a binary or system command that is ran as a child process.

## Names

A task name (or identifier) is a unique resource for locating a task _within_ a project. The name is
explicitly configured as a key within the [`tasks`](../config/project#tasks) setting, and can be
written in camel/kebab/snake case. Names support `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`, `.`, and must
start with a character.

A task name can be paired with a scope to create a [target](./target).

## Types

Tasks are categorized into 1 of the following types based on their configured parameters.

- **Build** - Task generates one or many artifacts, and is derived from the
  [`outputs`](../config/project#outputs) setting.
- **Run** - Task runs a one-off, long-running, or never-ending process, and is derived from the
  [`local`](../config/project#local) setting.
- **Test** - Task asserts code is correct and behaves as expected. This includes linting,
  typechecking, unit tests, and any other form of testing. Is the default.

## Configuration

Tasks can be configured per project through [`moon.yml`](../config/project), or for many projects
through [`.moon/tasks.yml`](../config/tasks).

## Inheritance

View the official documentation on [task inheritance](./task-inheritance).
