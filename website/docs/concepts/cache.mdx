title: Cache
---

moon's able to achieve high performance and blazing speeds by implementing a cache that's powered by
our own unique smart hashing layer. All cache is stored in `.moon/cache`, relative from the
workspace root (be sure to git ignore this folder).

## Hashing

Incremental builds are possible through a concept known as hashing, where in multiple sources are
aggregated to generate a unique hash. In the context of moon, each time a target is ran we generate
a hash, and if this hash already exists we abort early (cache hit), otherwise we continue the run
(cache miss).

The tiniest change may trigger a different hash, for example, changing a line of code (when an
input), or updating an npm package version, so don't worry if you see _a lot_ of hashes.

Our smart hashing currently takes the following sources into account:

- Command (`command`) being ran and its arguments (`args`).
- Input sources (`inputs`).
- Output targets (`outputs`).
- Environment variables (`env`).
- Dependencies between projects (`dependsOn`) and tasks (`deps`).
- **For Node.js tasks**:
  - Node.js version.
  - `package.json` dependencies (including development and peer).
  - `tsconfig.json` compiler options (when applicable).

## File structure

The following diagram outlines our cache folder structure and why each piece exists.

```shell
.moon/cache/
	# List of projects located on the file system. Will only exists when
	# projects are configured using globs.
	projectsState.json

	# Stores hash manifests of every ran task. Exists purely for debugging purposes.
	hashes/
		# Contents includes all sources used to generate the hash.
		<hash>.json

	# Stores `tar.gz` archives of a task's outputs based on its generated hash.
	out/
		<hash>.tar.gz

	# State of projects and their ran/running tasks.
	projects/
		<project>/
			# Information about the project, its tasks, and its configs.
			# Can be used at runtime by tasks that require this information.
			runfile.json

			<task>/
				# Contents of the child process, including stdout, stderr, and exit code.
				# Also contains the unique hash that is referenced above.
				lastRunState.json

	# State of tools within the toolchain. Mainly for tracking install times.
	tools/
		<tool>-<version>.json
```
