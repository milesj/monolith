title: File groups
---

File groups are a mechanism for grouping similar types of files within a project using file glob
patterns or literal file paths. These groups are then used by [tasks](./task) to calculate
functionality like cache computation, affected files since last change, deterministic builds, and
more.

File groups can be defined in 2 locations:

- In [`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project), which will be inherited by all projects.
- In [`project.yml](../config/project), which is unique to that project.

### Inherited file groups

A primary scenario in which to define file groups at the project-level is when you want to
_override_ file groups defined at the workspace-level. For example, say we want to override the
`sources` file group because our source folder is named "lib" and not "src", we would define our
file groups as followed.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*.test.*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
```

```yaml title="project.yml"
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'lib/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  # Inherit `tests` as-is
```

File groups defined in `project.yml` will override file groups defined in `.moon/project.yml` of the
same name, and _will not_ merge the value arrays.
