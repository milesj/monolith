title: File groups
---

File groups are a mechanism for grouping similar types of files within a project using file glob
patterns or literal file paths. These groups are then used by [tasks](./task) to calculate
functionality like cache computation, affected files since last change, deterministic builds, and
more.

## Configuration

File groups can be configured per project through [`project.yml`](../config/project), or for all
projects through [`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project).

## Inheritance and merging

When a file group of the same name exists in both [configuration files](#configuration), the
project-level group will override the workspace-level group, and all other workspace-level groups
will be inherited as-is.

A primary scenario in which to define file groups at the project-level is when you want to
_override_ file groups defined at the workspace-level. For example, say we want to override the
`sources` file group because our source folder is named "lib" and not "src", we would define our
file groups as followed.

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*.test.*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
```

```yaml title="project.yml"
fileGroups:
  sources:
    - 'lib/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    # Inherited as-is
```
