title: Targets
---

A target is an identifier that pairs a [project](./project) to one of its [tasks](./task), in the
format of `project_name:task_name`.

Targets are used by terminal commands...

```shell
$ moon run designSystem:build
```

And configurations for declaring cross-project or cross-task dependencies.

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
```

## Project scopes

While a target typically pairs project and task names, we also support advanced targets through a
concept known as project scopes. Scopes allow us to easily define targets with external or many
sources, but _are not available in all contexts_.

### All projects

> Only available on the command line when running targets.

For situations where you want to run a specific target in _all_ projects, for example `lint`ing, you
can utilize the all projects scope by omitting the project from the target: `:lint`.

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint

# Run `lint` in all projects
$ moon run :lint
```

### Dependencies `^`

> Only available when configuring a task.

When you want to include a reference for each project in your
[`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson) list, you can utilize the `^` scope. This will be
expanded to _all_ depended on projects. If you do not want all projects, then you'll need to
explicitly define them.

```yaml title="project.yml"
dependsOn:
	- 'apiClients'
	- 'designSystem'

# Configured as
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'webpack'
		deps:
			- '^:build'

# Resolves to
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'webpack'
		deps:
			- 'apiClients:build'
			- 'designSystem:build'
```

### Self `~`

> Only available when configuring a task.

When referring to another task within the current project, you can utilize the `~` scope, which will
be expanded to the current project's name. This is useful for situations where the name is unknown,
for example, when configuring [`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project). Or if you just want a
shortcut!

```yaml title=".moon/project.yml"
# Configured as
tasks:
	lint:
		command: 'eslint'
		deps:
			- '~:typecheck'
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'

# Resolves to (assuming project is "foo")
tasks:
	lint:
		command: 'eslint'
		deps:
			- 'foo:typecheck'
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'
```
