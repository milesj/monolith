title: Targets
---

A target is a compound identifier that pairs a [scope](#scope) to a [task](./task), separated by a
`:`, in the format of `scope:task`.

Targets are used by terminal commands...

```shell
$ moon run designSystem:build
```

And configurations for declaring cross-project or cross-task dependencies.

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'designSystem:build'
```

## Scopes

### Project

The most common scope is the project scope, which requires the name of a project, as defined in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace). This will run a specific task from that project.

```shell
# Run `lint` in project `app`
$ moon run app:lint
```

### All projects

> Only available on the command line when running targets.

For situations where you want to run a specific target in _all_ projects, for example `lint`ing, you
can utilize the all projects scope by omitting the project name from the target: `:lint`.

```shell
# Run `lint` in all projects
$ moon run :lint
```

### Dependencies `^`

> Only available when configuring a task.

When you want to include a reference for each project [that's depended on](./project#dependencies),
you can utilize the `^` scope. This will be expanded to _all_ depended on projects. If you do not
want all projects, then you'll need to explicitly define them.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
dependsOn:
	- 'apiClients'
	- 'designSystem'

# Configured as
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'webpack'
		deps:
			- '^:build'

# Resolves to
tasks:
	build:
		command: 'webpack'
		deps:
			- 'apiClients:build'
			- 'designSystem:build'
```

### Self `~`

> Only available when configuring a task.

When referring to another task within the current project, you can utilize the `~` scope, or emit
the `~:` prefix altogether, which will be expanded to the current project's name. This is useful for
situations where the name is unknown, for example, when configuring
[`.moon/tasks.yml`](../config/tasks), or if you just want a shortcut!

```yaml title=".moon/tasks.yml"
# Configured as
tasks:
	lint:
		command: 'eslint'
		deps:
			- '~:typecheck'
			# OR
			- 'typecheck'
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'

# Resolves to (assuming project is "foo")
tasks:
	lint:
		command: 'eslint'
		deps:
			- 'foo:typecheck'
	typecheck:
		command: 'tsc'
```
