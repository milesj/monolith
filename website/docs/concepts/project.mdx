A project is a library, application, package, binary, tool, etc, that contains source files, test
files, assets, resources, and more. A project must exist and be configured within a
[workspace](./workspace).

## Names

A project name (or identifier) is a unique resource for locating a project. The name is explicitly
configured within [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace), as a key within the
[`projects`](../config/workspace#projects) setting, and can be written in camel/kebab/snake case.
Names support `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`, and must start with a character.

Names are used heavily by configuration and the command line to link and reference everything.
They're also a much easier concept for remembering projects than file system paths, and they
typically can be written with less key strokes.

Lastly, a project name can be paired with a task name to create a [target](./target).

## Aliases

Aliases are a secondary approach for naming projects, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for
standard names. What this means is that an alias can also be used when configuring dependencies, or
defining [targets](./target).

However, the difference between aliases and names is that aliases _can not_ be explicit configured
in moon. Instead, they are specific to a project's primary programming language, and are inferred
based on that context (when enabled in settings). For example, a JavaScript or TypeScript project
will use the `name` field from its `package.json` as the alias.

Because of this, a project can either be reference by its name or alias, or both. Choose the pattern
that makes the most sense for your company or team!

## Configuration

Projects can be configured with an optional [`moon.yml`](../config/project) in the project root, or
through the optional [`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project) which applies to all projects.

### `package.json`

A moon project _does not require_ a `package.json`, but when one exists, the following functionality
is enabled.

- Dependency versions are included when computing cache keys and hashes.
- Depended on projects ([`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson)) are mapped as workspace
  dependencies (when applicable).

### `tsconfig.json`

A moon project _does not require_ TypeScript or a `tsconfig.json`, but when one exists, the
following functionality is enabled.

- Depended on projects ([`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson)) are mapped as TypeScript project
  references (when applicable).

> File name can be customized with the
> [`typescript.projectConfigFileName`](../config/workspace#projectconfigfilename) setting.
