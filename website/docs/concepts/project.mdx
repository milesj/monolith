A project is a library, application, package, binary, tool, etc, that contains source files, test
files, assets, resources, and more. A project must exist and be configured within a
[workspace](./workspace).

## ID

A project identifier is a unique resource for locating a project. The ID is explicitly configured
within [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace), as a key within the
[`projects`](../config/workspace#projects) setting, and can be written in camelCase, kebab-case, or
snake_case.

IDs are used heavily by configuration and the command line to link and reference everything. They're
also a much easier concept for remembering projects than file system paths, and they typically can
be written with less key strokes.

Lastly, a project ID can be paired with a task ID to create a [target](./target).

## Configuration

Projects can be configured with an optional [`project.yml`](../config/project) in the project root,
or through the optional [`.moon/project.yml`](../config/global-project) which applies to all
projects.

### `package.json`

A moon project _does not require_ a `package.json`, but when one exists, the following functionality
is enabled.

- Dependency versions are included when computing cache keys and hashes.
- Depended on projects ([`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson)) are mapped as workspace
  dependencies (when applicable).

### `tsconfig.json`

A moon project _does not require_ TypeScript or a `tsconfig.json`, but when one exists, the
following functionality is enabled.

- Depended on projects ([`dependsOn`](../config/project#dependson)) are mapped as TypeScript project
  references (when applicable).

> File name can be customized with the
> [`typescript.projectConfigFileName`](../config/workspace#projectconfigfilename) setting.
