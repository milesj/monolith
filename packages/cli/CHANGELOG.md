#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `moon init` not using the remote default branch when scaffolding.

#### ⚙️ Internal

## 1.12.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

## 1.12.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) support (experimental).
- Added an `interactive` field to task options. This marks tasks as interactive, so they can use
  stdin.
- Added an `extends` field to task configurations. This allows tasks to extend and inherit settings
  from sibling tasks.
- Updated task `env` values to support token functions and variables.
- Updated task `outputs` to support negated globs.

## 1.11.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where tasks using output globs would not always hydrate from the cache.

## 1.11.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- To support the new project graph, the order and priority in which environment variables are
  resolved has changed. Previously it was task-level > .env file > project-level. Now it's
  task-level > project-level > .env file.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Rewrote the project graph from the ground-up:
  - Lazily built using a multi-pass approach.
  - Graph edges now indicate the type of relationship: development, production, build, peer.
  - Updated `moon project-graph --json` to include the fully expanded graph data.
- Identifiers (project names, file groups, etc) can now be prefixed with underscores (`_`).
- Added Poetry detection support for Python projects.
- Added an `experiments` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- **Tasks**
  - Environment variables in `command` and `args` are now substituted.
  - Task `deps` can now depend on tag targets (`#tag:task`).
  - Task `env` are now used when substituting values, alongside system-level.
  - Task `outputs` can now use token variables.
- **Codegen**
  - Templates can be used as-is without rendering with [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app) by appending
    a `.raw` extension.
- **Query language**
  - Updated `project` to query both project name AND alias.
  - Added `projectName` for only querying by name.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where newer moonbase secret keys would fail to sign in.
- Fixed an issue where `@files` token would not invalidate the project graph cache.
- Fixed an issue where changing `.env` would not invalidate the project graph cache.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated to proto v0.13.
- Updated Rust to v1.71.

## 1.10.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `.gitignore` patterns weren't always applied correctly.
- Fixed an issue where `git hash-object` commands would fail if moon was setup in a sub-directory.
- Fixed an issue where our "upgrade moon" message would print when requesting JSON output
  (`--json`), resulting in JSON parsing errors.

## 1.10.0

#### 💥 Breaking

> These changes are fixing edge cases that should not have been allowed, but may break existing
> repos. If these changes become troublesome, we'll revert.

- Tasks that configure the same outputs will now error. This change was made as multiple tasks
  writing to the same output location will cause caching and hydration issues.
- If a dependency of a task failed to run or was skipped, then the parent task will now be skipped.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added support for `MOON_BASE` and `MOON_HEAD` environment variables.
  - Will be used when diffing across branches or commits.
  - Works for both `moon ci` and `moon run`.
- Added `deno.bins` setting to `.moon/toolchain.yml`.
- Added `hasher.ignorePatterns` and `hasher.ignoreMissingPatterns` settings to
  `.moon/workspace.yml`.
- Updated `moon ci` to include a summary of all failed actions.
- Updated `moon run` to compare against the previous commit when running on the default branch and
  using `--remote`.
- Updated `rust.bins` in `.moon/toolchain.yml` to support an object for each bin entry.
  - Can denote bins as CI or local only.
  - Can force install bins.
- Updated the run report to include stderr/stdout for all attempts.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where failed target run attempts would not appear in the run report.

#### 📚 Documentation

- Updated `moon init` to:
  - Detect an applicable VCS provider and set the `vcs.provider` setting.
  - Convert a detected tool version to a fully-qualified semantic version.
- **Node.js**
  - Moved syncing logic from `InstallNodeDeps` action to `SetupNodeTool` action. This includes
    syncing `packageManager`, `engines`, and version files. This should feel more natural.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where task hashes would be different between Windows and Unix machines.
  - Root cause is that arguments would use different path separators.
- Fixed an issue where `dev`, `start`, or `serve` tasks would not always be marked as `local`.

  on the merge strategy.
